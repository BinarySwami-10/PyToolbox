sir , did i just receive an average score 10/20 for the project , and my equally competent teammate receiving 18/20 just because i did not fill the peer evaluation form ?
me and my team mate wrote almost equal portion of base code ,
and can i tell you , myself have implemented:
+ multi-threading for web-scraping which multiplies the speed by several orders.
+ added  date/time filter
+ made an extension code to process the scraped data for better NLP applications.
+ twitter API  code was almost completely written by me

i believe all that effort was validating to  -8 Marks . only if i knew filling the form was valued 8 marks.
can you please provide me insights of my evaluation criteria ?
