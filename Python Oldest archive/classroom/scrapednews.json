      "\nFile photo.\n | Photo Credit: \nReuters\n  Banking data of nearly 29,000 Facebook staffers stored on unencrypted hard drives has been stolen from a payroll worker\u2019s car, the media reported.The hard drives contained information including bank account numbers, employee names, the last four digits of their social security numbers, their salaries, bonuses, and equity details.The stolen hard drives however, did not contain Facebook users\u2019 data.According to a CNBC report on Friday, Facebook said the hard drives contained unencrypted personal data of current and former employees, and alerted those employees to the theft \u201cout of an abundance of caution\u201d.The hard drives contained information on thousands of U.S. workers who were employed by Facebook in 2018.\u201cThe company also failed to notify employees until almost a full month after the break-in occurred on November 17,\u201d The Verge said in a report.An internal email revealed Facebook only realized the hard drives were missing on November 20, and confirmed that the drives contained employee information on November 29.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "AI puts final notes on Beethoven\u2019s Tenth Symphony",

      "\nA portrait of Ludwig van Beethoven. Photo: File\n A few notes scribbled in his notebook are all that German composer Ludwig van Beethoven left of his Tenth Symphony before his death in 1827.Now, a team of musicologists and programmers is racing to complete a version of the piece using artificial intelligence, ahead of the 250th anniversary of his birth next year. \u201cThe progress has been impressive, even if the computer still has a lot to learn,\u201d said Christine Siegert, head of archives at Beethoven House in the composer\u2019s hometown of Bonn.Siegert said she was \u201cconvinced\u201d that Beethoven would have approved since he too was an innovator at the time, citing his compositions for the panharmonicon \u2014 a type of organ that reproduces the sounds of wind and percussion instruments and she insisted the work would not affect his legacy because it would never be regarded as part of his oeuvre.The final result of the project will be performed by a full orchestra on April 28 next year in Bonn, a centrepiece of celebrations for a composer who defined the romantic era of classical music. \u201cIt's completely new territory,\u201d said Dirk Kaftan, conductor of the Beethoven Orchestra, which will perform the piece. \u201cWe musicians are in two minds about it.\u201dBeethoven, Germany\u2019s most famous musical figure, is loved in his homeland and critics of the project are concerned about protecting Beethoven\u2019s legacy. The \u201cnational duty\u201d to prepare for the anniversary was even written into a right-left coalition agreement to form a government six years ago.The year of celebrations officially begins on December 16 \u2014 believed to be his 249th birthday. But a press preview on Friday at the Beethoven House Museum in his native Bonn following a renovation offered insights into his genius, including the notebooks he used to communicate after going deaf in 1801 \u2014 26 years before his death.Beethoven began working on the Tenth Symphony alongside his Ninth, which includes the world-famous \u201cOde To Joy\u201d. But he quickly gave up on the Tenth, leaving only a few notes and drafts by the time he died aged 57. In the project, machine-learning software has been fed all of Beethoven\u2019s work and is now composing possible continuations of the symphony in the composer\u2019s style.Deutsche Telekom, which is sponsoring the project, hopes to use the findings to develop technology such as voice recognition. The team said the first results a few months ago were seen as too mechanical and repetitive but the latest AI compositions have been more promising. Barry Cooper, a British composer and musicologist who himself wrote a hypothetical first movement for the Tenth Symphony in 1988, was more doubtful.\u201cI listened to a short excerpt that has been created. It did not sound remotely like a convincing reconstruction of what Beethoven intended,\u201d said Mr. Cooper, a professor at the University of Manchester and the author of several works on Beethoven. \u201cThere is, however, scope for improvement with further work.\u201d He warned that \u201cin any performance of Beethoven\u2019s music, there is a risk of distorting his intentions\u201d but this was particularly the case for the Tenth Symphony as the German composer had left only fragmentary material. Similar AI experiments based on works by Bach, Mahler and Schubert have been less than impressive.A project earlier this year to complete Schubert;s Eighth Symphony was seen by some reviewers as being closer to an American film soundtrack than the Austrian composer\u2019s work.\nWhy you should pay for quality journalism - Click to know more"

      "Voices of Bollywood on Audible Suno",
      "Updated: December 13, 2019 18:20 IST\rPublished: December 13, 2019 18:20 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/voices-of-bollywood-on-audible-suno/article30298340.ece",
      "\nAnurag Kashyap, Tabu and Nawazuddin Siddiqui for Audible Suno  In a recording studio in Andheri, Tabu sits in front of a microphone in a flowy terracotta dress. \u201cBabes,\u201d she says, in a voice deeper than hers, \u201cMujhe paise ki zaroorat hai (I need money).\u201d Her brows are furrowed as she leans into the mic, flitting between the performances of a confused woman, demanding man, and a tense narration.The actor is lending her cadences to one of the 10 episodes of Audible Suno\u2019s Thriller Factory. Careful to not give too much away, Tabu says her story, Kala Gulab, follows a young woman stuck in a trap. The anthology audio show, overseen by filmmaker Anurag Kashyap, ties together crime and intrigue in an homage to Hindi mystery novels. Kashyap explains that the episodes\u2019 writer, Pravesh Bhardwaj, undertook an eight-month-long journey to perfect the scripts, largely inspired by the works of the late Hindi author, Ved Prakash Sharma. \u201cSometimes they were edited, sometimes adapted, and sometimes an element was borrowed and [built upon],\u201d he says.The pulp noir series is one of an offering of over 60 original audio shows curated exclusively for Indian listeners on the Audible Suno app. With a different actor voicing each of its 40-minute episodes, Thriller Factory\u2019s narrators also include names like Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Sachin Khedekar and Sapan Saran.On what drew him to the medium, Kashyap says, \u201c[The medium is] a storyteller and also a literature professor.\u201d He describes how audio books lend themselves to the genre, layered over the traditional experience of reading a text. \u201cThe music, sound design, pauses, breathlessness and sense of a chase \u2014 the emotions [are] heightened,\u201d he adds.Exploring Sharma\u2019s literature seemed like a natural choice for Kashyap. \u201cI grew up reading pulp [fiction] from him and other writers. [The books] have dramatic titles that sound great in English, but in Hindi, it\u2019s kind of kitschy and funny in a tongue-in-cheek way.\u201d Bhardwaj adapted the stories and directed the episodes, but the first episode, Apni Katl ki Supari \u2014 narrated by Siddiqui \u2014 is co-directed by Kashyap. \u201cNawaz was perfect. He relishes the language so much when he speaks it,\u201d he recalls.For Kashyap and Siddiqui, the process was reminiscent of their childhood, since they grew up listening to radio. \u201cOn Vividh Bharti [artistes] would narrate movies, and I used to wait for it every Sunday,\u201d shares the director. Tabu, on the other hand, has been revisiting the audio book experience for years now through Hermann Hesse\u2019s 1951 book of self-discovery, Siddhartha. \u201cThis was the only audio book I had, and I still have it,\u201d she shares. The trio usually find the time to delve into aural stories as they travel. The increasing traffic and growing economy were driving factors behind Audible\u2019s decision to arrive in India last year. Perhaps it will be in the midst of glacial city travels that vernacular pulp fiction will reincarnate. Let\u2019s hope we won\u2019t have to wait too long.

      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/the-second-edition-of-the-kochi-design-week-dec-12-14expands-to-include-a-lot-more/article30297224.ece",
      "\nfunctional and aesthetic top right : The four-legged Bandicoot thats replacing human beings employed in manual scavenging\n  When Vimal Govind MK and his three friends, all students of MES College of Engineering,Kuttippuram began to translate their Proof of Concept (POC), a robotic solution to manual scavenging, from paper to a commercial product, they founded Bandicoot, a robot weighing 500kg. \u201cThough it was a complete replacement for a human being in a manhole, it was not user friendly. It felt clumsy and weighed too much,\u201d recalls Vimal, co-founder and CEO, Genrobotics. A design intervention helped solve the problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n After the Kerala government sent the team to incubate at NTU Innovation & Incubation Center (NTUIIC), in Taiwan, Bandicoot returned having shed 300 kg. \u201cIt is currently being deployed in 12 States and used at 30 towns across India,\u201d says Vimal. \u201cKochi has 2,200 start ups and a majority are hardware incubators for whom design is critical. With Bandicoot, we realised the significance of design in hardware and the lack of it at hand. The Kochi Design Week (KDW) began with this need: to bring design experts and companies in IT to Kerala,\u201d says, M Sivasankar, Secretary to CM & IT Secretary. The demand for a convergence like this was expedited when a mobile incubator was set up in collaboration with the Internet and Mobile Association of India. \u201cIt was found that mobile apps from India did not feature in the top 100. We realised that it was because these were limited by design. It was then decided that, in the next five years, we need at least 10 of the top 100 apps to be from India. The government of Kerala thought that the question of appropriate design \u2014whether it be hardware software, mobile apps, AI or VR \u2014 was critical and the gap in this area needed to be addressed.\u201dTwo events had a big impact on the first Design Week last year. \u201cOne was the floods and the other the CM\u2019s call to rebuild a New Kerala. The slogan was \u201cbuilt back better\u201d. This generated a flurry of new designs in architecture and infrastructure \u2014 buildings, roads, drains \u2014 everything that was presented was designed better.\u201dThis edition also saw the prestigious Copenhagen Institute of Interaction Design participate and hold workshops addressing policy design and programme design. \u201cApart from product and architecture design, this was expanding to cover different fields. It was then decided to throw open the event to make it an open-ended platform.\u201dDesign leader Srini R Srinivasan, CEO Lumium set up a branch of his company in Kochi facilitating the proactive role of the government in bringing in a design policy. As curator of this edition, the President of World Organisation says, \u201cWe are having a host of workshops \u2014 masterclasses \u2014 that will give participants a hands on idea and feel of working with design. The importance of design, especially product design, has to be enforced to a larger audience.\u201d Srini will be taking a Masterclass along with Alok Nandi of IXDA.Aarthy Rao, a food stylist who\u2019s setting up a food installation says, \u201cDesign serves a certain function, which is creating appetite. Once you start following food design, it leads to eating right, healthy and serves a higher purpose.\u201d V Sunil, design thinker and co-founder of Motherland, is excited that design is at the crux of creativity and manufacturing.\u201cIt is good that the government has taken the lead but it must begin with design education. We don\u2019t have many design schools. We teach craft but we don\u2019t teach aesthetics.\u201d His company is currently engaged with an urban regeneration project in Jodhpur and is designing an ecosystem that combines culture with commerce.Arun Balachandran, CM\u2019s Fellow-IT who is coordinating the KDW, cites data to prove that Keralites are leading creative teams in all fields. \u201cIn Technicolor that made Lion King and Jungle Book, 20% of the workforce is from Kerala. There are many such examples. We have a talent pool but they have to go outside the state to work. We are trying to get the companies here.\u201dTo keep up the tempo, a Centre of Excellence in Design is scheduled to open in Kalamassery by mid-2020. With the expanding definition that began with solutions in the field of IT, the second edition of KDW finds itself moving into varied fields \u2014architecture, art, food and fashion. Arun points out that, in this new scheme, food design too is in focus. \u201cIsn\u2019t the Kerala sadya a naturally plated design?\u201dYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      " Kerala will produce 20,000 blockchain professionals in the next two years, in what could be a major revolution in this emerging technology in India, according to a top official.\u201cThe coming two years are crucial for us as we plan to produce 20,000 blockchain experts. The emphasis is on enhancing the quality of manpower steered by young startup companies,\u201d State IT secretary M. Sivasankar said at a two-day conclave \u2018BlockHash LIVE 2019\u2019, which began here on Thursday. \u201cThis is a great opportunity for us to build expertise in next-generation technology and knowledge sharing.\u201dOrganised by the Kerala Blockchain Academy (KBA) in association with Allianz Technology, India, the event saw industry leaders making a strong case for leveraging the potential of blockchain technology for public through capacity building and promoting research, development and entrepreneurship.\u201cBlockHash LIVE has been a great learning platform for us. We use this platform to check what we have achieved, our learning and future footprint,\u201d Mr. Sivasankar said. Described as the most promising cutting-edge technological innovation after the Internet, blockchain provides a tamper-proof immutable data storage system and transparency in digital applications. It has the potential to disrupt business domains such as cyber security, banking services, insurance, trade finance and retail by performing quicker, secure and transparent transactions, he said. Saji Gopinath, Director, Indian Institute of Information Technology and Management-Kerala (IIITM-K), emphasized on the importance of bringing together blockchain experts across the world to discuss the business potential of this new-age technology.Dignitaries at the inauguration spoke about the significance of blockchain in various industries in leveraging the technology for public good, and positioning Kerala as the country\u2019s blockchain hub.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "Rockstar Games\u2019 western masterpiece, Red Dead Redemption 2 (RDR2) is not only one of the best games of this decade, it also redefined an open-world game. Now, after a year of its release on consoles, it is finally out on the PC, in all its gorgeous glory. Complete with its online Westworld-like component that is always evolving.RDR2 is set before the first game, which focuses on the origins of the Van Der Linde gang, from the perspective of Arthur Morgan. Its deep storyline tells the poignant tale of a band of outlaws who perform daring heists, while the jaws of modern law-abiding society close around them. Truly a masterpiece in both its filmmaking and its storytelling.The open-world is wide and detailed as well as harsh, making survival all the more important. Yet, you can whittle away hours in cantering around on your horse hunting, fishing and making coffee. You can virtually stick up anyone for cash as a no-good thug or you could play as a straight gun outlaw and gentleman. In a way, RDR2 embodies its role-playing to its very core.In the PC version of the game, the environments are more challenging, with all the bugs and lofty system requirements.From stuttering, to crashes, and performance issues, the game at launch was nigh unplayable. Which is why we delayed the review, until we saw Rockstar was committed to fixing everything. You will need a beefy PC though, to actually experience the game in its full glory, which is a sight to behold. Especially at true 4K, with all effects turned on, it is a sight that will melt your eyeballs.RDR2 Online lets you feel like you are living in the wild west, with Rockstar always keeping things exciting with bounties and seasonal events. Making replayability excellent, if you want to keep coming back. It is hard not to recommend RDR2, which is a game you have to experience to believe. Just wait until it is all patched before you jump in. Real-time strategyIt has been 20 years since the classic Age of Empires II (AOEII) was unleashed. I still remember being hunched over my Windows 98 PC, basking in the radiation glow of the CRT monitor, playing until the wee hours of the morning, while my friends were spending their college days partying. Now, it has re-released in glorious 4K Ultra and that cycle starts all over again.There is a reason why AOEII is one of the most popular real-time strategy games out there. In this definitive edition, you get to play as one of the 35 civilisations, as you set out to grow your villages into towns. Amass resources and create powerful armies and advance across the ages, from the dark to the imperial age across a 1000-year timespan. If you choose not to play as a random map, you can choose a campaign that focused on Genghis Khan, Joan of Arc, William Wallace, Barbarossa or Saladin\u2019s historic storylines.Undoubtedly, what AOEII will be most remembered for is the multi-player. Where you jump into death-matches with opponents, playing as certain civilisations, to amass resources and create an army before they do. Which is surprisingly still nail-bitingly good.Being able to play the game in 4k is fantastic, if you have the monitor for it, or if you are hooked up to a 4k TV. The visuals are crisp, and the screen now packs in more detail. Though with the slightly older sprites sort of coloured in, sometimes it looks as though you are seeing double, which is disconcerting.If you reminisce on those good old days of Age of Empires II, the Definitive Edition is the perfect way to rustle up the old gang and get back into the game in 4k.The writer is a tech and gaming enthusiast who hopes to one day finish his sci-fi novelYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

Especially at true 4K, with all effects turned on, it is a sight that will melt your eyeballs.RDR2 Online lets you feel like you are living in the wild west, with Rockstar always keeping things exciting with bounties and seasonal events. Making replayability excellent, if you want to keep coming back. It is hard not to recommend RDR2, which is a game you have to experience to believe. Just wait until it is all patched before you jump in. It has been 20 years since the classic Age of Empires II (AOEII) was unleashed. I still remember being hunched over my Windows 98 PC, basking in the radiation glow of the CRT monitor, playing until the wee hours of the morning, while my friends were spending their college days partying. Now, it has re-released in glorious 4K Ultra and that cycle starts all over again.Age of Empires II: Definitive EditionDeveloper: Forgotten Empires, Tantalus Media, Wicked WitchPublisher: Xbox Game StudiosPrice: \u20b91,000 on PCThere is a reason why AOEII is one of the most popular real-time strategy games out there. In this definitive edition, you get to play as one of the 35 civilisations, as you set out to grow your villages into towns. Amass resources and create powerful armies and advance across the ages, from the dark to the imperial age across a 1000-year timespan. If you choose not to play as a random map, you can choose a campaign that focused on Genghis Khan, Joan of Arc, William Wallace, Barbarossa or Saladin\u2019s historic storylines.Undoubtedly, what AOEII will be most remembered for is the multi-player. Where you jump into death-matches with opponents, playing as certain civilisations, to amass resources and create an army before they do. Which is surprisingly still nail-bitingly good.Being able to play the game in 4k is fantastic, if you have the monitor for it, or if you are hooked up to a 4k TV. The visuals are crisp, and the screen now packs in more detail. Though with the slightly older sprites sort of coloured in, sometimes it looks as though you are seeing double, which is disconcerting.If you reminisce on those good old days of Age of Empires II, the Definitive Edition is the perfect way to rustle up the old gang and get back into the game in 4k.The writer is a tech and gaming enthusiast who hopes to one day finish his sci-fi novel\nWhy you should pay for quality journalism - Click to know more"

      "Design experts share their thoughts on technology's growth over the last 10 years",
      "Updated: December 12, 2019 15:31 IST\rPublished: December 12, 2019 14:41 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/the-decade-that-was/article30284788.ece",
      "The 2010s might not have witnessed a groundbreaking invention such as the wheel or fire or even smartphones (which was seen in the preceding decade itself) but this tiny phase of human history, it can be argued, marked the spread of communication technology among the masses. Smartphones and the Internet became ubiquitous even in many developing economies \u2014 according to a Pew Research Centre report, there are at least over 2.5 billion smartphone users. Social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, which were largely used for recreation in their nascent stage, became hotbeds of serious affairs such as business and politics (fake news and negative impact of mental health were their side effects). MetroPlus asked four tech design experts from various fields of their thoughts on technology in the 2010s.(The designers quoted in the article participated in the DesignUp conference held in Bengaluru in November)Katja Forbes: The era of smartphonesThe very first iPhone was released in 2009. There has not been a more impactful smartphone ever since. It undoubtedly changed the way we did things. With it, Apple nailed the ease-of-use. For years, everyone else was playing catch-up with them. But I never really owned an iPhone. Because I was already owning a Macbook and designers can get trapped into an ecosystem. So, after Blackberry, I deliberately went for an Android phone\u2026 an HTC. But now, as we approach the end of the 2010s, Apple has been left behind.In the next 10 years, I think smartphones are going to get smarter. We will be seamlessly moving from one interaction to another with different smart devices. Today, we take these devices for granted. But they have literally changed the way we interact with our friends and family. For instance, look at the amount of data we record. At no other point in time has life been recorded so much. But sometimes I also think since almost everything is digital, if all data gets erased somehow, what will remain of our history?(Katja Forbes is the Managing Director of Designit, Australia & New Zealand, a strategic design firm)Payal Arora: Rethinking the traditional practicesAfter being excluded for a very long time, globally, the low-income population have been increasingly becoming consumers of the digital world, especially over the last 10 years. If data is the new oil, then, these guys are going to be the next billion users that generate and consume data. So, tech and Internet companies must take them into account when they are designing their products. So far, they have been neglected and have been told by their governments and markets to \u2018take what you get\u2019. But it\u2019s time to put empathy back into design. These Internet companies have to spend time and money to know who their users are and what they want. Facebook and MySpace, essentially, were social networking sites. But then Facebook became big not because it looked better but because it understood its users well and made subtle changes. So, companies must sensitise themselves when they enter a new market.(Payal Arora is a digital anthropologist and author of The Next Billion Users. She is a professor at Erasmus University Rotterdam)Simone Rebaudengo: The complications of making things simpleEveryone\u2019s been talking about the Internet of Things. It\u2019s essentially where all your devices will be connected to a larger cloud. From digital steering wheels to our home lamps, things can be connected and operated from elsewhere. We, of course, think it makes our devices and our lives simple. But it\u2019s not linear. For example, with a toaster, you know that if you connect it to electricity, it will work. You can see the process unfold in front of you. But when you are connected to the cloud, you don\u2019t really see what\u2019s happening. Like the lamp you got from IKEA might not be physically broken, but it won\u2019t light up because you are unable to upgrade the latest software. Everything is great until it\u2019s broken, but now you don\u2019t know how to fix it.(Simone Rebaudengo is a product and interaction designer based in Shanghai, where he works with international clients like BMW, Philips and Google Creative Labs)Jon Kolko: Embracing the analogueI\u2019ve been dramatically impacted by a return to analogue and calming technology \u2014 I\u2019ve re-embraced things like musical instruments and handicrafts. I started playing the sitar, and I began painting and turning bowls on the lathe again. I\u2019ve found that what was once an escape from digital has become my norm, with digital becoming a side distraction. I\u2019ve abandoned non-professional uses of social media, and have made an effort to immerse myself back in nature. And this has, in turn, made me a better designer. I\u2019ve become more sceptical of technology as a solution for our business and design problems, and have been more aggressive in proposing simple, tech-light solutions to my clients and partners. It hasn\u2019t been a difficult change, and it\u2019s been a very fulfilling one.(Jon Kolko is the founder of Austin Center for Design, an educational institution teaching interaction design and social entrepreneurship)(The designers quoted in the article participated in the DesignUp conference held in Bengaluru in November)You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

With this new functionality, you can do exactly that.

      "\nIt was only on October 27, 2009 that Parliament amended the Information Technology Act of 2000 to protect online intermediaries from liability for criminally defamatory content published in them by third parties./ File photo\n | Photo Credit: \nAP\n In a shock for online platforms like Google, the Supreme Court on Tuesday held that internet intermediaries cannot be protected from criminal defamation cases registered against them prior to October 27, 2009.It was only on October 27, 2009 that Parliament amended the Information Technology Act of 2000 to protect online intermediaries from liability for criminally defamatory content published in them by third parties.The amended Section 79 of the 2000 Act provided that \u201can intermediary shall not be liable for any third party information, data, or communication link made available or hosted by him.\u201d The amendment gave almost blanket protection to intermediaries from legal action under Section 499/500 (criminal defamation) of the Indian Penal Code.A Bench of Justices Mohan M. Shantanagoudar and K.M. Joseph pronounced the 148-page judgment on the basis of an appeal filed by Google India Pvt Ltd. The appeal was against a criminal defamation action on the basis of a complaint filed by M/s Vishaka Industries, a manufacturer of asbestos cement sheets. Vishaka accused the co-ordinator of a Google group called \u2018Ban Asbestos India\u2019 and Google India for authoring/hosting defamatory articles against their products in 2008. The accused were asked to appear in court in September 2009 \u2013 that is before the amendment in Section 79 came into existence.\u201cWe hold that Section 79 of the Act, prior to its substitution, did not protect an intermediary in regard to the offence under Section 499/500 of the IPC,\u201d Justice Joseph, who wrote the judgment, concluded.The verdict noted that Google India argued it was not a publisher of third-party content. Nor does it have knowledge of any content unless notified through an order of an appropriate court or a government agency. Google argued that its role is \u201cpassive.\u201d\u201cThe intermediary cannot become a private censor or arbiter of content.., it would have an adverse impact on freedom of online speech and expression,\u201d the judgment recorded the submissions made by Google India.In fact, the government too agreed with Google India. \u201cThere will be a chilling effect on free speech if one were to allow intermediaries to intervene merely on complaints by individuals about being defamed or being at the receiving end of the unfair reporting,\u201d the judgment recorded the government's submissions.The government had said that its powers to block online information does not expand to blocking any case of defamation, contempt of court, etc. You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "Too Much Equal? Feminist memes and Instagram",

      "When actor Shane Nigam acknowledged male privilege he was applauded for being gender sensitive. The Instagram page Too Much Equal posted the video on its page, with a \u2018thank you\u2019. A couple of days later they followed it up with a video grab of Rima Kallingal\u2019s TED Talk where she spoke about sexual harassment, and social media abuse in particular, Too Much Equal put in a reminder of how viciously Rima was trolled in its aftermath. \u201cShane\u2019s reaction was shared multiple times, while Rima was trolled. What she said made sense, but nobody bothered to listen. We are just holding up the mirror to the behaviour,\u201d says Rose Mary who founded the page which posts feminist memes. With it she says she \u2018trolls\u2019 the \u201cculture of patriarchy rooted over years of conditioning, which will take time to change.\u201d The above post is one of Too Much Equal\u2019s serious posts, the others are humorous but by no means light-hearted even those targeting casual, everyday misogyny. The name of the page, she adds, is a nod to the perception that women have too much equality.Rose Mary, a post-graduate in Local Governance and Development, is district co-ordinator, Kerala Institute of Local Administration and is based in her home town, Perumbavoor. A huge fan of meme and troll pages, she realised some of the humour in these communities derived from gender insensitivity and sexism. So when she started out a year ago, in November 2018, she wasn\u2019t sure how a page dedicated to feminism would be received. She wondered if people would pay attention. The initial content was testing waters to suss the response. She generated the content that was more a random commentary on current political/social topics. \n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, when her memes appeared on Dankmemesmalayalam\u2019s Instagram handle her page started getting traction. The team has grown to include four others\u2014 Nithin Mathew, Keerthana Sukesh, Azmia Riaz and Neetha Shenoy. While Azmia and Neetha are friends, the others she met via the page. In fact Keerthana started out as a follower who turned contributor. Now all of them generate content, besides contributions by followers. \n\n\n\n\n\nSome of the memes are hard-hitting, and she has had people questioning her about being extreme. \u201cBut sometimes you have to be, to get the point across,\u201d she says. She believes humour is an effective tool to get a message across, \u201cif an unpleasant fact is pointed out with humour, it might be more effective than blaming or assuming an accusatory tone.\u201d The comments under some of the memes frustrate her, but over the last one year she has learnt to let go and not get overly affected. In a happy turnabout, and the best possible feedback, men are among the largest contributors of content, \u201cwhich shows that there are more feminist men, the change is perceptible.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\nYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "Here are some apps and an emergency number, 112, that you can reach out to for safety",
      "Updated: December 9, 2019 15:04 IST\rPublished: December 9, 2019 12:04 IST",

      "Over the last week, following the disturbing and heinous crimes against women, citizens are more concerned and vigilant about their safety. A few days ago, citizens were requested to download the Bengaluru City Police Suraksha App (which can be downloaded on both android and Apple phones). The app, so far, according to a recent report by The Hindu, has been downloaded about 40,000 times! The app connects users to the police control room to get help immediately. Even though some have said the app works well, others have complained that the interface and registering on it is a tedious process. Be that as it may, the fact that the government and citizens are raising awareness on women\u2019s safety is encouraging. You can also download the 112 emergency helpline app, introduced by the Government of India. In which one can send out a request for help by pressing a button to relay emergency messages. The Karnataka government launched 112 as an emergency number on mobile phones about a month ago. We, at MetroPlus, dialled 112 to see if it works. A lady immediately took our call and informed that it is working and is meant for services such as police, fire, and health during emergencies. Among the several safety apps, My Safetipin app has been around since 2013. Kalpana Viswanath, co-founder and CEO of Safetipin, says: \u201cIt has had several updates since 2013. There have been about 100,000 downloads of the app all over India so far.\u201d There are five key features, she adds: \u201cWhen you open the app, it will give you safety score wherever you are. This safety score is calculated on the basis of two things \u2014 an audit is carried out based on eight parameters, such as street lights, the number of people there, transport, and more. You can also do a safety audit yourself. Each road, based on the pins of each audit is marked in red, yellow, or green, (where red is unsafe and green is safe). We also have a safest route feature, in which if you are going from point A to point B, it will give you the safety score of each route. We have a tracking feature, which is, in a place you don\u2019t feel safe you can ask someone to track you. You can either do an audit or express how you feel with a smiley. We also have safetipin night app.\u201dKalpana adds there have been a couple of thousand audits in Bengaluru. She states that this is not an emergency app: \u201cA number of emergency apps have been launched, but we don\u2019t believe any private party will give you safety. I don\u2019t want to give false beliefs. My Safetipin is to help women move about safely, it is not an emergency app.\u201d The second user of the app, says Kalpana, are city and municipal entities. \u201cThey work with us to see what changes can be made, such as improving streets, putting more street lights, and improving last mile connectivity. We had in fact partnered with BPac. We have also looked into safety around bus stops and even in places where there wasn\u2019t much public transport available.\u201d You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nBy the 50th mission, the PSLV would have launched 319 small satellites and around 63 satellites of Indian origin. | File\n | Photo Credit: \nR. Ragu\n It has taken 26 years for the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) to close in on that thrilling milestone \u2014 the 50th mission.But the next 50 would not take even half as long, given the changing demand profile of Indian Space Research Organisation\u2019s (ISRO) trusted launch vehicle, said S. Somanath, Director, Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC), Thumba.\u201cThis is the inflection point where the rate of growth is suddenly changing. Today we realise the numbers we need \u201410 missions per year. We have taken 26 years to reach the 50th flight. But now, in the next five years, we will be making another 50,\u201d Mr. Somanath told The Hindu, commenting on the upcoming 50th flight \u2014 the PSLV-C48 mission \u2014 planned on December 11 from Sriharikota.By the 50th mission, the PSLV would have launched 319 small satellites and around 63 satellites of Indian origin, he said.The first PSLV mission \u2014 the PSLV-D1 \u2014 lifted off on September 20, 1993.On its 50th mission, the PSLV will carry India\u2019s RISAT-2BR1 and nine smaller foreign satellites.The 49 missions so far have been marred by only two failures.Over the years, ISRO has developed variants of this four-stage rocket \u2014 PSLV-XL and PSLV-CA to mention two.But the space agency had no immediate plan to make drastic changes in design or configuration, Mr. Somanath said. \n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\n\nISRO\u2019s landmark rocket launches\n\n\n\n\n\nISRO\u2019s landmark rocket launches\n\u201cThe current goal is to productionise the launcher; increase the numbers, bring down manufacturing costs and improve reliability through technology infusion. Also, we are exploring the possibility of retaining the fourth stage as an orbital platform,\u201d he said.Efforts to create an industry consortium for productionising the PSLV was under way, he added.In the formative years of the PSLV programme few people could have imagined that the rocket would have such a long run, Mr. Somanath said.The rocket\u2019s core strength lay in its being a flexible, mid-size launcher as much as in the robust design, he said.\u201cFifty is significant in the global context. Not many launch vehicles have attained as many missions. Moreover, mid-size rockets have a large potential in the current scenario. The market size of a small rocket is limited to small satellites. A big one, on the other hand, can carry only five tonne or six-tonne satellites, which is again limited in numbers. But a mid-size rocket has the potential to carry small satellites in larger numbers,\u201d he said.PSLV was also important in that it was used in India\u2019s first lunar mission and the interplanetary mission to Mars. \u201cThough it is classified as a polar satellite launch vehicle, it is no longer that; it is a \u2018VSLV\u2019 \u2014 a versatile satellite launch vehicle,\u201d Mr. Somanath said.

      "\nThe iPhone maker was partnering with Taiwanese touchscreen maker GIS to develop an iPhone for 2020 or 2021 that could use the under-display tech, MacRumors reported\n | Photo Credit: \nREUTERS\n Apple is reportedly planing to use Qualcomm\u2019s ultrasonic fingerprint sensor technology in one iPhone model, set to be released in 2020.The iPhone maker was partnering with Taiwanese touchscreen maker GIS to develop an iPhone for 2020 or 2021 that could use the under-display tech, MacRumors reported on Wednesday.Qualcomm unveiled the new 3D Sonic Max ultrasonic fingerprint reader on Tuesday at its third annual Snapdragon Technology Summit. Qualcomm supplies ultrasonic fingerprint sensors for Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S10 and Galaxy Note10 smartphones. But iPhones could use an even more advanced version of the technology by 2020 or 2021 rolls in. JP Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee believes, Apple will release a 5.4-inch iPhone, two 6.1-inch iPhones and one 6.7-inch iPhone with 5G connectivity in 2020.Chatterjee predicts the company may introduce two high-end models (one 6.1-inch and one 6.7-inch) with support for mmWave, as well as a triple-lens camera and \u201cworld facing\u201d 3D sensing for improved augmented reality capabilities. While, two low-end models (6.1-inch, 5.4-inch) will not have mmWave or World facing 3D sensing, and will have a dual-lens camera. As per the report, Apple may use Qualcomm\u2019s X55 modems in all its 2020 iPhones, which support both mmWave and sub-6GHz spectrum. All four iPhone models will have OLEDs.

      "\nGoogle fired the four named employees \u201cto discourage and chill employees from engaging in protected concerted and union activities,\u201d the filing states.\n | Photo Credit: \nAP\n The Communications Workers of America (CWA) union filed a federal labour charge against Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google on Thursday, accusing the company of unlawfully firing four employees to deter workers from engaging in union activities.The complaint, seen by Reuters, will trigger a National Labour Relations Board (NLRB) investigation into whether Google violated the four individuals\u2019 right to collectively raise concerns about working conditions.Google fired the four named employees \u201cto discourage and chill employees from engaging in protected concerted and union activities,\u201d the filing states. \u201cIts actions are the antithesis of the freedoms and transparency it publicly touts.\u201dGoogle did not respond to a request for comment on the filing, though it has said the four workers were let go for violating the company\u2019s data-security policies.Google also last month acknowledged hiring a consultancy known for defeating unionism.The CWA union, which represents 7,00,000 North Americans working at AT&T Inc, Walt Disney Co and companies in several other industries, has been trying to organise workers at Google, said Laurie Burgess, an attorney at Messing Adam & Jasmine who worked on the NLRB filing.The union stepped forward to make the charge against the company \u201cbecause it has been harmed by Google\u2019s actions,\u201d she said.If at the end of its investigation the NLRB finds Google has a case to answer, the union could seek to reach a settlement or, ultimately appeal to a court.CWA spokeswoman Beth Allen said its organising director has been in touch with Google employees for some time to offer assistance.\u201cIt\u2019s a good partnership we have and through their own organising if they decide they want to form a union, we are here to help them,\u201d she said. \u201cWe really believe in workers leading their own struggles.\u201dThe four workers, who were fired November 25, \u201cvisibly led and participated in\u201d organising at Google, according to the filing.\u201cI was fired for organising my co-workers and advocating for better working conditions for everyone who works at Google (including employees, temps, vendors, and contractors),\u201d one of the workers, Paul Duke, said in a tweet on Wednesday.He and others in social media posts since their exit have alleged that Google, which has faced a swell of worker activism over the past two years, wanted to demonstrate consequences for speaking out.Duke and sacked co-workers Laurence Berland and Sophie Waldman publicly signed a petition in August, urging Google to reject business from three U.S. immigration agencies that the petition said had mistreated migrants. The fourth fired worker, Rebecca Rivers, had protested Google policies that appeared to undermine its support for people who identify as gay, lesbian or transperson.When the NLRB finds violations, it typically tries to help accusers and companies reach a settlement.Google in September announced such a settlement after an employee accused the company of firing him for his conservative political views. Google said it agreed to remind employees that its \u201cpolicies do not prevent employees from discussing workplace issues.\u201dThe company has long prided itself on listening to employee feedback and even adjusting course on the spot based on ideas at all-staff meetings. But it now serves more than 3 billion consumers and business customers across search, navigation and health technology, and it faces fierce competition in advertising and increased regulatory scrutiny.The company in the last year has reeled in elements of its unorthodox culture, such as by cutting back on company-wide meetings next year, as it deals with its much broader influence.Workers and investors have been able to exercise limited oversight over Google\u2019s practices because co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin control Alphabet\u2019s shareholder voting power.The co-founders stepped down on Tuesday from their executive roles but retain their votes and board seats.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

The complaint filed in the federal court in San Francisco seeks unspecified damages and a Facebook ban.Facebook said this kind of lawsuit is rare, and that it has since April notified hundreds of thousands of users that their accounts may have been compromised.The Menlo Park, California-based company said it has also issued more than $4 million in refunds to customers whose accounts were used by ILikeAd to run unauthorised ads.\u201cCloaking\u201d involves disguising the content of a link by displaying one version of that content to Facebook and another version to users.\u201cCreating real-world consequences for those who deceive users and engage in cloaking schemes is important in maintaining the integrity,\u201d Jessica Romero, Facebook\u2019s director of platform enforcement and litigation, said in a statement.According to the complaint, ILikeAd promoted itself as a \u201cone-stop comprehensive solution to advertisers\u201d hoping to market their wares on Facebook.The case is Facebook Inc v ILikeAd International Co et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 19-07971.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

One of the biggest changes for Pichai will be taking responsibility for those so-called \u201cmoonshots,\u201d which are aimed at diversifying Alphabet\u2019s business.Alphabet has put in billions of dollars into ventures Wall Street has never been completely sold on, including self-driving cars, atmospheric balloons to deliver internet service, delivery drones and smart contact lenses.\u201cThe question is, will they continue to spend money on these other bets? Under the new leadership, are they going to take a harder look at all of these businesses and start to try to focus more on ones that provide growth,\u201d said Daniel Morgan, a portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company, which owns Alphabet shares worth over $100 million. \u201cThat would add an extra excitement about the stock.\u201dAlphabet\u2019s Other Bets division, which includes those ventures, had an operating loss of $3.4 billion last year, compared to a $36.5 billion operating profit delivered by Google. Pichai now faces the challenge of balancing the potential benefit of bold, uncertain bets about future technology with their short-term costs.Investments in Other Bets have already been cut over the last two years, as Alphabet pushes more money into Google\u2019s cloud computing and consumer hardware businesses. Pichai could continue that trend.\u201cI don\u2019t think this means they\u2019re going to discard their other bets. I think they'll continue to explore other potential business opportunities, but those may be under greater scrutiny,\u201d said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments LLC, which holds shares of Alphabet on behalf of its clients.Page and Brin, both 46, will remain directors of the parent company and still control it through their ownership of preferred shares. As of April, Page held 26% of Alphabet\u2019s total voting power, Brin 25% and Pichai less than 1%.King Lip, chief investment strategist at Baker Avenue Asset Management in San Francisco, said he expected decisions to be made faster under Pichai, who has spent 15 years at Google and rose to prominence while leading the development of Google\u2019s Chrome browser.\u201cHe can execute more effectively without having to worry about stepping on the toes of Page and Brin,\u201d Lip said.The company\u2019s stock has risen 70% since Pichai became CEO of Google, which accounts for close to 99% of Alphabet\u2019s total revenue.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nNow, when you share one-off photos and videos, you will have the option to add them to an ongoing, private conversation in the Google Photos app\n | Photo Credit: \nREUTERS\n Google is making it easier to share everyday moments quickly through Google Photos by adding a private messaging feature.Earlier, to share individual photos through the app, one needed to create an album for a single photo and share the link. Now, when you share one-off photos and videos, you will have the option to add them to an ongoing, private conversation in the app.\u201cThis gives you one place to find the moments you\u2019ve shared with your friends and family and keep the conversation going,\u201d Janvi Shah, Product Manager for Google Photos, wrote in a blog post on Tuesday.Google said this feature is not designed to replace the chat apps people already use, but it hopes to improve sharing memories with one\u2019s friends and family in Google Photos. \u201cYou can like photos or comment in the conversation, and you can easily save these photos or videos to your own gallery,\u201d Shah said.\u201cThis is gradually rolling out over the next week and, as always, you can share these photos with your friends and family across all platforms \u2014 Android, iOS and the web \u2014 without any loss in image quality from the photos you backed up,\u201d she said.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

FTC and Amazon declined to comment on the report.In cloud computing, one of the fastest-growing areas in the technology industry, businesses rent out servers from Amazon instead of running their own data centers.Amazon is the biggest cloud services provider, competing most closely with Microsoft Corp. Smaller companies also compete to provide services on cloud networks to developers and corporate customers.Analysts expect Amazon\u2019s cloud unit to generate $34.9 billion in sales in 2019, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.In addition to the FTC probes, the Justice Department and House of Representatives Judiciary Committee are investigating all four big tech companies.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nUntil now, Instagram except for limited circumstances has required its 1 billion users only to say they are at least 13 years old\n | Photo Credit: \nAFP\n Facebook Inc\u2019s Instagram said it will require birthdates from all new users starting on Wednesday, expanding the audience for ads for alcohol and other age-restricted products while offering new safety measures for younger users.Until now, Instagram, except for limited circumstances, has required its 1 billion users only to say they are at least 13 years old.Instagram said advertisers were not the driving force for the new requirement. Gambling and birth control are among other types of ads restricted to older audiences by Instagram policies and laws.The policy change could help stave off passage of costly child safety and data privacy regulations as lawmakers and family safety groups in the United States, Britain and elsewhere criticize the app for exposing children to inappropriate material.The birthdate requirement is the latest step Instagram has taken to move away from longstanding principles such as anonymity that had distinguished it from Facebook\u2019s namesake app.\u201cUnderstanding how old people are is quite important to the work we're doing, not only to create age-appropriate experiences but to live up to our longstanding rule to not allow access to young people,\u201d Instagram's head of product Vishal Shah said in an interview with Reuters.He declined to specify age-based features in testing, but said age could be the basis for recommended privacy settings or in-app education about staying safe online. Birthdates will not be visible to other users.In addition, Instagram will introduce in the coming weeks options for users to block messages from people they do not follow and for both businesses and popular users who are known as \u201ccreators\u201d to more easily restrict minors from viewing their posts, Shah said.Scrutiny of Instagram increased as it overtook Facebook\u2019s main app in popularity among teens and young adults and became a leading contributor to Facebook\u2019s revenue growth.Instagram will not verify birthdates because teens often cannot prove their age, and it will still be left without birthdays of some existing users. Instagram expects most people will be honest about birthdates and said artificial intelligence could eventually aid verification.Jeffrey Chester, who focuses on kids\u2019 safety issues at the Washington-based Centre for Digital Democracy, described Instagram\u2019s new policy as \u201clong overdue\u201d to come in step with U.S. laws aimed at preserving the online privacy of children under 13.But the London-based National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children said asking for \u201can unverifiable date of birth will do nothing in practice to protect children from harmful or age-inappropriate content.\u201dUntil now, Instagram required birthdates only in limited circumstances.Users who had merged their Instagram profile and Facebook account, which requires a birthdate to create, turned over the data. Minors in the European Union over the last 18 months also had to submit birthdates so the company could comply with the region\u2019s new data privacy law, known commonly as GDPR.The existing birthdays, along with some rough analysis by workers poring over posts mentioning \u201chappy birthday\u201d and other terms, has helped Instagram train machine learning software that predicts a user\u2019s age and gender.The automated prediction also takes into account the variety of posts someone makes and the hashtags used.Instagram employs its predictions to understand usage patterns by age and gender. But Shah said Instagram is reluctant to use predictions to personalise features or determine whether someone is lying about their age because of reliability and transparency concerns. The forthcoming birthdate data will help improve accuracy, Shah said. \u201cIt\u2019s important for us to use people\u2019s explicit (birthdate) input for now, but that might change,\u201d he said.Current users who have not linked their Instagram and Facebook accounts will be able to add their birthdates starting Wednesday, but the company is still debating whether it would be too intrusive to make it mandatory, Shah said. Instagram knows whether some of those users are adults, for instance, because it asks them to say so before looking at profiles of alcohol and sexually explicit businesses.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nA creative of one of AudioHop\u2019s popular podcasts in collaboration with Fittr\n | Photo Credit: \nSpecial arrangement\n A new Pune-based content start-up, called AudioHop is focusing solely on podcasts. Founder Piyush Shinde, 30, who has been at this now for eight months, claims that his venture is only the second \u201cpremium podcast network\u201d in India after IVM Podcasts of Indus Vox Media, which was founded by Amit Doshi.\u201cThe reason I believe in audio is that there\u2019s huge market [in India], but there\u2019s [not enough quality] content,\u201d Shinde says, adding that \u201ca lot of people create podcasts because they think its easy \u2014 that\u2019s a myth.\u201d AudioHop already has four shows ongoing. This includes one in partnership with Fittr, an online health community, on food histories and our contemporary relationship with items like cheese, potatoes, almond, and soya. The host for this show is fitness entrepreneur Jitendra Chouksey, founder of SQUATS (Systematic Quantitative Unified Aesthetic Training System. Another such featured podcast is in collaboration with columnist Sudha Menon. Called Fabulous at Fifty, it is a spin off from her 2018 book, Fiesty at Fifty, and deals with a lot of otherwise taboo or unspoken topics in a relaxed manner. The Fittr podcast especially has found favour with listeners, he says, claiming to have over 7,000+ unique listeners within two months of the show. \u201cI see podcasting as an immersive experience,\u201d says Shinde, adding that most podcasts have kept to a typical chat-show-like format. According to PwC\u2019s Global Entertainment & Media Outlook 2019-2023 India, \u201cIndia\u2019s music, radio and podcasts market was worth \u20b95753Cr in 2018, up from \u20b93890Cr in 2014...Podcast listening has increased markedly in India in the past few years. Monthly listeners (defined as people who listened to at least one podcast in the last month) totalled 4Cr at the end of 2018, up a sharp 57.6% from 2.54Cr in the previous year. This made India the world\u2019s third-largest podcast-listening market (after China and the U.S.), although it ranks much lower on a per capita basis. Growth is set to continue over the forecast period with listener numbers set to increase at a 34.5% CAGR to 17.61Cr by 2023.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPiyush Shinde\n\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps the reason Sweden-based audio streaming platform Spotify is targeting its India expansion plans with localised non-music content, like original podcasts. Launched just yesterday, these include a cricket podcast called 22 Yarns with former TV host Gaurav Kapur, a show on relationships called Love Aaj Kal, and a fictional thriller called Bhaskar Bose. Other global platforms like Audioboom, Overcast, Apple Podcasts also have had a slew of Indian shows with stars and independent content producers alike. Shinde has two more shows coming up by the end of this month, and aims for his content to go niche in 2020. More shows that aim to bring thought leaders and changemakers into the podcasting space, he says.For more, audiohoppodcasts.com; free to stream"

      "\nXiaomi has partnered with five shadow banking and fintech firms for the service, which will audit the creditworthiness of customers and disburse loans\n | Photo Credit: \nREUTERS\n Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp launched its online lending service in India on Tuesday, widening its offering of financial products in one of the world\u2019s biggest web services markets.Xiaomi\u2019s Mi Credit connects smartphone users with lending firms, giving them access to quick loans of up to 100,000 rupees ($1,393.34), the company's India head Manu Jain told reporters.The company has partnered with five shadow banking and fintech firms for the service, which will audit the creditworthiness of customers and disburse loans.Beijing-headquartered Xiaomi first moved into India\u2019s fast-growing financial services space in March with Mi Pay, which allows bill payments and money transfers.While smartphones are the core of its business, Xiaomi earns low margins from its affordable devices and relies on services for long-term profit.According to forecasts by research firm Boston Consulting Group, India\u2019s digital lending market may be worth $1 trillion by 2023.Mi Pay has already pitched the firm against global tech giants Amazon and Alphabet\u2019s Google, which offer similar services in India.\u201cFor now, India definitely is our biggest market outside China, not only in Credit but pretty much in everything else,\u201d said Hong Feng, the company\u2019s co-founder and senior vice-president.\u201cWe need to focus ourselves to make it really successful. We need to bring in more partners, bring more products, bring more users to make it really scale up. That\u2019s our focus for the next 12 months.\u201dXiaomi is not in a hurry to expand into more geographical regions, Feng added.In Indonesia, another key market, Xiaomi\u2019s financial unit had to shut down in late 2018 due to a disagreement with regulators over licensing.On Tuesday, Jain also sought to allay concerns over privacy of Mi Credit users in a country which is yet to make a law on data protection. User data is 100% encrypted and cannot be misused, Jain said.\u201cWe have strong data protection agreements with each of our partners that they cannot use this data for any other purpose, apart from giving loans to users,\u201d he added.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nThe viral smartphone app saw a surge in popularity this year due to a filter that ages photos of users\u2019 faces\n | Photo Credit: \nAFP\n The Federal Bureau of Investigation considers any mobile app developed in Russia to be a \u201cpotential counterintelligence threat,\u201d it said on Monday, responding to a U.S. lawmaker\u2019s query about face-editing photo app FaceApp.The viral smartphone app saw a surge in popularity this year due to a filter that ages photos of users\u2019 faces.Concerns about its Russian provenance prompted the Democratic National Committee to warn the party\u2019s 2020 presidential candidates against using it, as well as a call from Democratic U.S. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer for the FBI and the Federal Trade Commission to conduct national security reviews.There is no evidence that FaceApp provides user data to the Russian government. But the FBI, in a letter responding to Schumer, said Moscow\u2019s ability to access communications directly via internet service providers makes any app built there risky.Russia\u2019s intelligence services maintain \u201crobust cyber exploitation capabilities,\u201d the FBI said, and are able under local laws to \u201cremotely access all communications and servers on Russian networks without making a request to ISPs.\u201dFaceApp, which launched in 2017, was developed by Wireless Lab, a company based in St. Petersburg. Its chief executive officer, Yaroslav Goncharov, used to be an executive at Yandex, widely known as \u201cRussia\u2019s Google.\u201dThe company has denied selling or sharing user data with third parties, adding that user data is never transferred to Russia and most images are deleted from its servers within 48 hours of submission.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nJesper Kyd  | Photo Credit: \nSpecial Arrangement\n Jesper Kyd has been composing music every day since he was 13. The Danish music composer\u2019s career goes beyond professional work. A browse through Jesper\u2019s Spotify artiste profile reveals he has an average of 4,10,505 monthly listeners. His fans are not just gamers though, given Jesper has written music for series such as Mortal  Kombat X and even 2018 Hindi film Tumbbad. The 47-year-old won a BAFTA (British Academy of Film and Television Arts) Games Award in 2005 for Best Original Music for Hitman: Contracts.Jesper\u2019s hit list2019: Borderlands 32018: State Of Decay 2, Warhammer: Vermintide 22016: Assassin\u2019s Creed: The Ezio Collection2015: Warhammer: End Times \u2013 Vermintide, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel \u2013 Claptastic Voyage2014: Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel!, Sparta War Of Empires2013: State Of Decay2012: Borderlands 2, Darksiders II2011: Assassin\u2019s Creed: Revelations, Forza Motorsport 42010: Assassin\u2019s Creed: Brotherhood2009: Assassin\u2019s Creed: Bloodlines, Borderlands2007: Assassin\u2019s Creed, Kane & Lynch: Dead Men2006: Hitman: Blood Money2005: Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory2004: Hitman: Contracts2002: Minority Report, Hitman 2: Silent Assassin2000: Hitman: Codename 471994: Red Zone, The Adventures of Batman & RobinRecent projects continued to garner curious ears, particularly for the Assassin\u2019s Creed games and Borderlands 3. There are many different elements \u2014 drums, claps, bass \u2014 all melded into a varietal score which reflects the zany and wild nature of the Borderlands franchise. \u201cYou have to really immerse yourself into a project at the deepest level possible,\u201d says Jesper, who has worked on the franchise for almost 10 years. He adds, \u201cBorderlands is not the most serious game as it likes to poke fun at itself, but the composition and production itself is taken seriously, despite the game going into more comedic areas. Having said that, I know the people at Gearbox [the developers] well, especially audio lead and music director Raison Varner, and they know me as a composer.\u201d Jesper explains that the team at Gearbox had no requests around the music but rather that they let his creativity run free, making it a stress-free process. Composing for gaming at the beginning of a gaming project can be stressful, points out Jesper, given there are few visual elements. \u201cIt can feel forced to make music that is not ready to come out yet. You are trying to figure out way too many things. With Borderlands, it is helpful to know what the score has to become, because of the ranging story-lines.\u201dFor many gamers, music is a key hype-factor in gearing up for the game. Music for the initial menu screen has to pack a punch, after all. Jesper\u2019s strategy is all about venturing into the unexpected. \u201cI wanted something that would give you a taste of this massive world and experience; it is something I was aiming for. Even though you would be chilling at the menu screen, looking at your character, the music aims to give a certain depth, while also reminding you of what may not be on that screen. I love to remind people about what is present in that world or story, but not necessarily something they are watching or playing at that moment. There is the idea that if your player goes into a dark, scary cave and you have music much like that, then that is fine. But I believe that if you bring music, especially for an immersive platform like a video game, where the music goes beyond what is on screen, the experience is deepened.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAssassin\u2019s Creed: Ezio Collection \n| Photo Credit: \nSpecial Arrangement\n \n\n\n\n\nJesper, like most veteran music professionals, does have his favourite hardware to work with: Doepfer LMK4+, Eurorack Modular, Yamaha CS-80, Prophet 10 and the Juno 60. But talk software and he favours Cubase (Steinberg), EQuality (DMG Audio), Ohmicide (Ohm Force), HD Cart (Reverb Foundry), and TC1210 (TC Electronic).But how has technology evolved to enhance composition for video games? \u201cIn early days, you would be at your studio, at the piano, and you would basically have the director come over and have a listen of what has been created. Now, however, the delivery of that music itself is different. I try to use both analogue and digital equipment to get the best of everything into a single mix. Technology also lets you meld different sounds into a score, such as choirs and screams. With Borderlands 3, some of the technology is the most advanced I have seen in my career as far as a music system is concerned. Let us say I take a piece of music for a part where the player is exploring a certain part of the world, such as a jungle, where there is an abandoned spaceship. At this point, the player is not engaged in combat but is more exploratory. This music is called \u2018exploration music\u2019 and is a three-minute piece divided into four or five sections. Those sections become modules which have to talk to each other. At the same time, I deliver those sections in front of layers.\u201d Jesper elaborates that, thanks to avenues of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, players can then see the possibilities of the permutations and orders of playing that music. Suddenly, the game is playing this unique soundtrack on the side, and remarkably, if the player revisits that part, the music may sound different. But Jesper says he is not worried about AI ever being a full-fledged composer, because composing is a very emotional and personal process.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "Meet environmental engineer Prasanth Omanakuttan, who is offering a solution to e-waste problem",

      "\nElectronics recycling\n | Photo Credit: \nGetty Images/iStockphoto\n E-waste is a real threat, says Prasanth Omanakuttan during a tour of Green Era Recyclers, an e-waste recycling facility, located on the outskirts of Coimbatore. \u201cIt is the second-most threatening and hazardous waste, after radioactive or bio-medical waste. There are about 60 to 100 components in e-waste that are hazardous to consumers and the environment,\u201d he reveals, as we stop at a counter with CPUs and monitors neatly arranged on the shelves. \u201cThese are in perfect working condition and will easily last another three or four years,\u201d he says. Founder Prasanth and his team are doing just that. They reduce, reuse, recycle, refurbish, replenish and recover gadgets and give them an extended lease of life. They either repair them or reclaim parts from them to be used in other products. The plastics and steel are recycled, he says.\u2018Circuit\u2019 world: Fast computing devices like mobile phones, computers and laptops, use precious metals for quick transmission. The discarded circuit boards, processors, and rams are segregated, graded and then sent for recovery of those metals such as silver, platinum, palladium and gold and other base metals like copper and aluminium. Then they are sent to recycling units in Chennai, Bengaluru and Mumbai. Steel, copper and aluminium are smelted and reused.Destroy: Data in the wrong hands is always a threat. Any CPU, laptop or USB, contains data, even after you format it. Anything deleted from a storage device can always be recovered. In corporates, IT companies and also those in manufacturing and design, data security is of foremost importance. The testing team secures confidential data in storage devices and ensures that the data is wiped off using a clinical methodology.Upcoming:Green Era Recyclers abides by the rules and regulations of the Central and State Pollution Control Board (CPCB and SPCB), Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF). They plan to upgrade the facility so as to handle 1,000 to 1,500 tonnes of e-waste per year, catering to clients pan-India. On a pilot basis, they are working on a project along with the corporation to channelise e-waste collection from households. Instead of an additional bin for e-waste, they can collect e-waste as a part of dry waste and then later segregate it. Once successful, this can be replicated across the country.To know more, visit www.thegreenera.in or call 8300223526.One can only guess the volume of e-waste being generated. At the facility, electronic waste is piled up in every corner. Used computers, monitors, laptops, keyboards, printers, scanners, and tablets, share space with tonnes of wires and cables, and discarded refrigerators, washing machines, microwaves, AC compressors, music systems and ear phones. There are fluorescent lamps too. \u201cWe are designing a machinery to powder the bulbs and trap the mercury content in it, before we send it to the hazardous waste disposal facility at Gummidipoondi in Chennai. One has to extract lead from computer monitors (every monitor has a lead coating) before we dispose them. Many electronics carry heavy metals such as mercury, lead, lithium, and other materials that pollute the air when incinerated or poison the ecosystem as they invade the landfills.\u201d There is no awareness or a channel to dispose e-waste, admits Prasanth.\u201cMy focus is on integrated e-waste management, where the waste is used as a by-product to make something new. For example, making plastic tiles with recycled plastics and power banks from discarded batteries.\u201dWhat led 25-year-old Prasanth, an environmental engineer, to e-waste, is the first question that pops up when we settle for a chat. He looks around his room and says, \u201cThere is a laptop, switch boxes, chargers, desktop... this small room alone has 100 kilograms of e-waste. Every household easily generates 100 to 200 kilograms.\u201dPrasanth emphasises that all old, usable or unusable electronic items can be refurbished or can be disposed in an environment-friendly manner. \u201cIndia is the fourth-largest contributor of e-waste after Europe, China and the US. We generate 2.5 million tonnes every year (with a 30% increase every year). Tamil Nadu is the second-largest contributor at 13%, which is about 3.5 lakh tonnes. The e-waste hubs in Delhi and Mumbai are choked. We need better infrastructure to handle the tonnes of e-waste.\u201dThe three-year-old start-up has so far recycled over 150 tonnes of e-waste and has reduced carbon footprint emission by 0.0034%. Green Era Recyclers is chosen as one of the top three start-ups in the environment field and is incubated at Vel Tech Technology Business Incubator (TBI), Chennai. \u201cWe are ideating on automation and digitisation. We will go for a prototype first and then pitch for funding.\u201d Government policies are in place, says Prasanth. For example, producers have to declare conformance to RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances) in manufacturing, but more needs to be done. \u201cWe have a guideline for manufacture and supply. But what about disposal? It is so easy to buy an iPhone, but when I want to dispose it, I do not know where to go. In a start-up ecosystem, there are investors for block chain technology or AI, but when it comes to e-waste management, there is always a concern about returns. The government should come forward and support us with subsidies.\u201dSelf-realisation is important, he says. \u201cFrom ink pens, we have moved on to plastic ball pens. We use virgin paper instead of recycled paper. We have to value every single product, be it a bike or a gadget. Take an effort to repair and reuse. Don\u2019t give in to temptation whenever a new mobile phone hits the market (you have to worry about the EMIs too!).\u201dPrasanth says, on an average, an individual generates 1.2 to 1.8 kilograms of e-waste, annually. \u201cMy vision is to create a system for households to streamline e-waste. And, have a Waste Park where e-waste can be laid to rest.\u201dYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      " A new YouTube policy allows creators to upload video games with scripted or simulated violent content without bothering about getting automatically hit by age-restriction gates.The new policy which came into effect on Monday paved the way for making such video games available to everyone, including those who stated their age to be below 18 years. \u201cWe know there\u2019s a difference between real-world violence and scripted or simulated violence \u2014 such as what you see in movies, TV shows, or video games \u2014 so we want to make sure we\u2019re enforcing our violent or graphic content policies consistently,\u201d YouTube said in a product update. \u201cThere will be fewer restrictions for violence in gaming, but this policy will still maintain our high bar to protect audiences from real-world violence,\u201d the Google-owned video-sharing platform said. YouTube said it may still age-restrict content if violent or gory imagery is the sole focus of the video. For instance, if the video focuses entirely on the most graphically violent part of a video game.This policy enforcement update, however, does not change advertiser-friendly guidelines.So if a video is considered too violent for advertisers, it will continue to run the risk of being demonetised even if it is fine by YouTube\u2019s standards, The Verge reported.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/app-takes-education-through-games-to-tribal-schools-in-state/article30143383.ece",
      "\nPraveen Tyagi, founder of EduisFun Technologies, during the launch of STEPapp on Monday.\n A new mobile application focusing on the gamification of learning for students, called the Student Talent Enchancement Program application (STEPapp), was unveiled in the city on Monday.The application has been used at 16 Eklavya Model International Schools, the government-run residential schools for tribals, for the last four months and has been designed by a team of 400 IITians over seven years, backed by EduisFun Technologies. The app provides education to students from kindergarten to Class XII through games across subjects focussing on students\u2019 interest.Praveen Tyagi, founder of EduisFun Technologies, said his journey to Indian Institute of Technology Delhi and then to teach young minds had been possible through education. \u201cIf you take my family as an example, two of my brothers are in IITs, all of us are where we are because we were pushed to learn and educate ourselves,\u201d he said.Mr. Tyagi said STEPapp\u2019s developers had made sure it is accessible, affordable, adaptive and attractive for those who want to build their future. \u201cSuccess is dependent on the learning exposure. If we are considering brick-and-mortar educational institutions, sports is next to learning and then comes infrastructure. I believe the content of education is what matters, irrespective of whether the learner is sitting at the G.D. Somani School or Eklavya Model International School,\u201d Mr. Tyagi said.Manisha Verma, principal secretary of State tribal development department, spoke about the inclusivity of the app. \u201cRecruiting quality teachers in tribal areas is a huge problem, because even if we provide permanent jobs with accommodation, a lot of the highly-qualified teachers do not want to shift their bases to tribal areas. This is why the students are lagging behind when it comes to interaction with trained professionals and broadening their mental horizon. STEPapp could help bridge this gap. Sixteen tribal schools have already been using the application for four months,\u201d she said.Author Sonia Golani spoke about how STEPapp will benefit women and young girls. \u201cThere are only 30% or less women enrolling in engineering colleges in India. I feel newer-age edutech applications like this will help Indian women unleash the huge untapped potential that they have in them to be economic leaders,\u201d she said.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nThe expansion of the rules is being considered even though the Trump Administration last week agreed to grant some reprieves on the existing ban and continues to seek a deal to de-escalate a bitter trade war\n | Photo Credit: \nREUTERS\n The U.S. government may expand its power to stop more foreign shipments of products with U.S. technology to China\u2019s Huawei, amid frustration the company\u2019s blacklisting has failed to cut off supplies to the world\u2019s largest telecoms equipment maker, two sources said.The U.S. Commerce Department in May placed Huawei Technologies on a trade blacklist, citing national security concerns. Putting Huawei on the entity list, as it is known, allowed the U.S. government to restrict sales of U.S.-made goods to the company, and some more limited items made abroad that contain U.S. technology.But under current regulations, key foreign supply chains remain beyond the reach of U.S. authorities, prompting inter-agency discussions within the administration of President Donald Trump about possible changes to two key rules that could expand U.S. authority to block more foreign shipments to the company, giving more teeth to Huawei\u2019s blacklisting, according to two people familiar with the matter.The expansion of the rules is being considered even though the Trump Administration last week agreed to grant some reprieves on the existing ban and continues to seek a deal to de-escalate a bitter trade war.If the Commerce Department makes the proposed rule changes, it will allow U.S. authorities to regulate sales of non-sensitive items, such as standard cell phone chips, made abroad with U.S.-origin technology, software, or components to Huawei, which is the world's second largest smartphone maker.Huawei and the Commerce department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The changes would represent \u201ca major expansion of the reach of U.S. export controls and would be poorly received by U.S. allies and U.S. companies,\u201d said Washington trade lawyer Doug Jacobson.He predicted the actions would upset supply chains but that ultimately Huawei would find other companies to fill the gaps.One rule the Commerce Department and sister agencies are focused on broadening is known as the De Minimis rule, which dictates whether U.S. content in a foreign-made product gives the U.S. government authority to block an export, the people said.Officials also may expand the so-called Direct Product Rule, which subjects foreign-made goods that are based on U.S. technology or software to U.S. regulations.It is not clear how close the administration is to making a decision about the changes, nor whether they would be introduced gradually or suddenly. It also was not immediately clear how the rule-making might take place, though sources said the changes would likely affect only Huawei.Some China hawks within the administration are hoping for swift results, the people said.In the months after Huawei was added to the entity list, suppliers such as Intel Corp, Xilinx Inc and Micron Technology Inc resumed some shipments to the Chinese company after conducting internal reviews to assess what products were not subject to the ban.Xilinx Chief Executive Victor Peng, for example, told Reuters in July that the company determined that its older, 28-nanometer chips and some chips not designed for 5G gear could legally could be sold to Huawei without a special license. To sell to a blacklisted company, suppliers subject to U.S. rules generally need to apply for and receive a special license.Xilinx and the other companies did not explain why they decided they did not fall under the entity list ban.The new rule considerations come just days after the Commerce Department gave two important wins to the blacklisted company, whose suppliers need special licenses to sell Huawei U.S. manufactured products.Last week, the agency renewed the so-called temporary general license for Huawei for a third time, extending permission for it to engage in limited transactions to maintain U.S. rural network operators.And on Wednesday, the Trump administration issued a batch of some 75 licenses to allow some suppliers to restart sales to the company after Huawei was placed on a trade blacklist six months ago.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\n\u201cWe review international law as well as relevant US and other domestic laws before making a determination in labelling on our Maps and make changes if required by law,\u201d Apple said in a statement\n | Photo Credit: \nREUTERS\n Apple, which showed the controversial annexed Crimean peninsula as part of the Russian territory on its location-based apps, has changed how Crimea is displayed in its Maps and Weather apps and will take a \u201cdeeper look\u201d at how disputed borders are shown.Ukraine criticised the Cupertino-based tech giant for showing Crimea as part of Russia\u2019s territory on its Maps and Weather apps.The annexed region, which has a Russian-speaking majority, has now been removed from being shown as Russian territory on Apple Maps and its Weather app, reports 9to5mac.com.\u201cWe review international law as well as relevant US and other domestic laws before making a determination in labelling on our Maps and make changes if required by law,\u201d Apple said in a statement.\u201cWe are taking a deeper look at how we handle disputed borders in our services and may make changes in the future as a result. Our intention is to make sure our customers can enjoy using Maps and other Apple services, everywhere in the world,\u201d it added.The peninsula on the north side of the Black Sea was brought under the Russian control in March 2014 during political unrest there concerning Crimea\u2019s status within Ukraine.According to a report in BBC, the State Duma, the Russian parliament\u2019s lower house, said in a statement: \u201cCrimea and Sevastopol now appear on Apple devices as Russian territory.\u201dApple had been in talks with Russia for several months over what the State Duma described as \u201cinaccuracy\u201d in the way Crimea was labelled.Search engine giant Google, in 2014, agreed to portray Crimea as part of Russia for users inside Russia. And now, users outside Russia will see Crimea\u2019s capital Simferopol without an accompanying country at all.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

The action was to impact accounts belonging to the deceased\n | Photo Credit: \nAP\n After a backlash from its users, Twitter has decided not to remove inactive accounts until it finds a way to memoralise accounts of the deceased.The micro-blogging platform on November 26 announced to permanently delete inactive accounts from December 11 that have not been used for more than six months. The action was to impact accounts belonging to the deceased.\u201cWe\u2019ve heard you on the impact that this would have on the accounts of the deceased. This was a miss on our part. We will not be removing any inactive accounts until we create a new way for people to memorialize accounts,\u201d Twitter said late on Thursday.\u201cThis impacts accounts in the EU only, for now. We\u2019ve always had an inactive account policy but we haven\u2019t enforced it consistently. We\u2019re starting with the EU in part due to local privacy regulations (eg. GDPR),\u201d it added.The company had said that as part of its commitment to serve the public conversation, it is working to clean up inactive accounts to present more accurate, credible information people can trust across the platform.In a fresh post, it said: \u201cBeyond complying with GDPR, we may broaden the enforcement of our inactivity policy in the future to comply with other regulations around the world and to ensure the integrity of the service. We will communicate with all of you if we do. We apologize for the confusion and concerns we caused and will keep you posted.\u201dFacebook lets dead users\u2019 friends and family report them as deceased and set up a special page for sharing memories about that person.Twitter currently does not have a way to memorialise someone\u2019s account once they have passed on, but the team is thinking about ways to do this.Any account that hasn\u2019t signed in for more than six months will receive the Twitter alert before the micro-blogging platform takes the action.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nThe unmanned aerial vehicle weighs 1.5 kg and has an estimated top speed of 200 kmph.\n | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement Hardware prototyping centre and makerspace T Works test-flew a fully 3D printed unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) 50 km from Hyderabad.The UAV featured a range of 3D printed parts from materials such as PLA (Polylactic Acid), ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) and HIPS (High Impact Polystyrene). The UAV, which weighs 1.5 kg and has an estimated top speed of 200 kmph, was designed, 3D printed and assembled in-house at T Works. The test results will be used to analyse the structural and aerodynamic properties for future applications of 3D printed UAVs.CEO of T Works Sujai Karampuri said, \u201c3D printing allows low-risk and fast-track prototyping. There were days when people would spend 400-500 hours shaping every single part of a model aircraft with balsa wood and plywood. Today, prototyping has become so easy wherein we only need to design on computers and 3D printers will bring our creations to reality.\u201dRapid prototyping (3D Printing) will reduce the drudgery in making aircraft, allowing people to experiment with more innovative designs. The UAV took 100 hours to design and 3D print, after which the parts were slot-fitted and assembled without any nuts, bolts or screws.The series of experiments by T Works will serve as a test bed for new autonomous technologies and potential 3D printing applications in the aerospace industry.The team experimented with different internal \u2018infill\u2019 structures and found a honeycomb-like structure to be the most effective and lightweight for the purpose of structural strengthening for thin-walled structures. The team also developed a custom lithium polymer battery pack and found innovative ways to use micro-controllers for serial communication, which significantly reduced cost and complexity.An initiative of the Telangana government, T Works will have state-of-the-art prototyping equipment run by a dedicated team of some of the best design, engineering and fabrication talent in India. According to Mr. Karampuri, T Works, under construction currently, will commence operations in five months. It will also host an advanced aero modelling workshop in December, where participants will design, build and fly their own UAVs.

Specifically, it will supply on-cell touch flexible OLED panels.This means Chinese panel producer BOE will not be a supplier of OLED panels to Apple for iPhones aside from Samsung and LG.\u201cWhile there is a high chance that BOE, which had drawn many interests, will suffer a sad defeat, South Korean display manufacturers will continue to enjoy being the sole OLED suppliers of Apple. This news confirms once again that South Korea is far ahead of China when it comes to mobile display,\u201d said the report on Wednesday.The 5.4-inch, 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch new iPhone models set to be released in the fall of 2020 are expected to be applied with three different sizes of OLED panels. Samsung OLED panels have touch function built-in.\u201cAlthough Apple had been sticking with film touch method since its first iPhone, Samsung Display has succeeded in drawing a change from Apple by actively promoting Y-OCTA technology to Apple,\u201d a representative for the industry was quoted as saying.\u201cIt is heard that Samsung Display also suggested shocking terms in order to obtain an order from Apple,\u201d he added.In order to stabilise supply and demand, Apple has also chosen LG Display to be a supplier of 6.1-inch film touch method-based OLED panel.Media reports in August claimed that the Cupertino-based tech giant was \u201caggressively testing\u201d BOE\u2019s flexible OLED displays to cut costs and reduce dependency of South Korean players.Founded in Beijing in 1993, BOE is one of the world\u2019s largest display makers, supplying screens for smartphones, TVs, and other electronic devices and home appliances.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nA screegrab from the TikTok video  | Photo Credit: \nTwitter/feroza.x  Social media app TikTok apologised to a user on Thursday for removing a video that criticised China's treatment of Muslims, blaming a \u201chuman moderation error\u201d and saying the images had been restored within less than an hour.The controversy over the video, viewed 1.6 million times, comes as TikTok's Chinese owner, ByteDance, faces an inquiry by a U.S. national security panel over its handling of personal data, while U.S. lawmakers fear it may be censoring politically sensitive content.In the video she posted last week, the user, who identifies herself as Feroza Aziz, gave a tutorial on eyelash curling, while talking about how Muslims were being treated, and saying she wanted to spread awareness of the situation.But on Twitter this week she said she had been blocked from posting on TikTok for a month, and on Wednesday posted that her viral video had been taken down, only to be restored later.The video was offline for 50 minutes, TikTok said on its website.\u201cWe would like to apologise to the user for the error on our part,\u201d said Eric Han, the app's U.S. head of safety.\u201cDue to a human moderation error, the viral video from November 23 was removed. It's important to clarify that nothing in our community guidelines precludes content such as this video, and it should not have been removed,\u201d he said. The TikTok user did not immediately respond to requests from Reuters for additional comment.China's foreign ministry said it had no specifics of the case, when queried by Reuters about the incident on Wednesday.But it added that it required Chinese firms to operate in a way that respected international norms and local laws and regulations, and hoped that relevant countries also provided a fair and non-discriminatory environment.TikTok is not available in China, but ByteDance has a domestic version called Douyin.The user did not mention Uighurs in the video, but said later on Twitter she had been referring to the minority ethnic group.United Nations experts and rights groups estimate more than a million Uighurs and members of other ethnic groups have been detained in camps in China's far western region of Xinjiang, which has triggered international condemnation.China says the camps are vocational training centres to impart new skills and help root out and prevent extremism.ByteDance has stepped up efforts to ring-fence TikTok, popular with U.S. teenagers and those in their 20s, from much of its Chinese operations, Reuters reported on Thursday.In a timeline on its blog post, TikTok said it had blocked another account set up by Ms. Aziz that had posted an image of Osama Bin Laden which violated its content policies regarding \u201dterrorist imagery\u201d.On Monday, it enforced a device ban on accounts associated with violations. This affected the new account from which Ms. Aziz had posted the eyelash curling video and sent from the same device, it said.It said it had decided to override the device ban and was directly contacting her to do so.Ms. Aziz confirmed on Twitter that TikTok had restored her account but said other past videos had been deleted.\u201cDo I believe they took it away because of a unrelated satirical video that was deleted on a previous deleted account of mine? Right after I finished posting a three-part video about the Uyghurs? No,\u201d she posted on Twitter.

      "\nThe new Amazon Web Services chip uses technology from Softbank Group Corp-owned Arm Holdings, the sources said.  | Photo Credit: \nREUTERS\n Amazon.com Inc\u2019s cloud computing unit has designed a second, more powerful generation of data centre processor chip, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, the latest sign that the company is pouring money into custom silicon for its fastest-growing business.The new Amazon Web Services chip uses technology from Softbank Group Corp-owned Arm Holdings, the sources said. One of the sources familiar with the matter said it will be at least 20% faster than Amazon\u2019s first Arm-based chip, named Graviton, which was released last year as a low-cost option for easier computing tasks.If Amazon Web Services\u2019 chip efforts are successful, it could lessen the unit\u2019s reliance on Intel Corp and Advanced Micro Devices Inc for server chips.An Amazon spokesman declined to comment on future products or services. Arm declined to comment.In cloud computing, businesses rent out servers from Amazon instead of running their own data centres. Analysts expect Amazon\u2019s cloud unit to generate $34.9 billion in sales in 2019, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.Cloud computing has become big business for data centre chip makers. Intel controls more than 90% of the server processor market, with AMD controlling most of the remainder. Intel\u2019s data centre group generated almost of half of the company\u2019s overall operating profit last year.And most server chips go to the cloud. In 2018, almost 65% of Intel\u2019s data centre chip sales were from cloud and communications service providers, its executives have said.Chip designers using Arm technology want to challenge Intel\u2019s dominance. Arm chips power mobile phones today. But several companies aim to make them suitable for data centres, including start-ups run by former executives from Intel and Apple Inc.Amazon\u2019s first Arm chip did not appear to have an impact on Intel\u2019s data centre business, which continued to grow over the past year, said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. But he said major technology companies, who spend billions each year with Intel and AMD with few alternatives, have the resources to make more powerful Arm chips.Amazon\u2019s Arm effort appears to be making progress, one of the sources said. The new chip\u2019s speed gain \u201csends a message to the market\u201d that Amazon is serious about investing in Arm-based chips, the person said.Both sources familiar with the matter said the new chip is not expected to be as powerful as Intel\u2019s \u2018Cascade Lake\u2019 or AMD\u2019s \u2018Rome\u2019 chips.Though less powerful, Arm chips are cheaper and consume less electricity than Intel\u2019s top-end chips. Intel\u2019s most powerful chips can cost several thousand dollars, while barebones Arm-based server chips can cost less than $1,000.In a data centre that houses tens of thousands of servers, chip buyers often focus on a mix of factors \u2014 speed, chip size, power consumption and cooling costs \u2014 called the \u2018total cost of ownership.\u2019 That is where Arm-based offerings hope to one day compete with Intel.Amazon\u2019s first Graviton chip used Arm\u2019s older Cortex A72 technology. The forthcoming Amazon chip is expected to use newer Arm technology, most likely Arm\u2019s Neoverse N1 technology, one of the sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Another source familiar with the matter said the chip is expected to have at least 32 cores versus the Graviton\u2019s 16.The new chip will also use a technology called a \u201cfabric\u201d that will allow it to connect with other chips to speed up tasks like image recognition, one of the people familiar with the matter said.To take advantage of the new chip, cloud customers likely will need to use software written for Arm-based chips, which is less common than software for Intel and AMD chips.\u201cThe hardware is only part of the equation,\u201d the second source familiar with the matter told Reuters.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nThe Chinese technology company is seeking to provide assurances to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) that personal data held by TikTok, which is widely popular with U.S. teenagers, is stored securely in the United States  | Photo Credit: \nREUTERS\n ByteDance has stepped up efforts to separate its social media app TikTok from much of its Chinese operations, amid a U.S. national security panel\u2019s inquiry into the safety of the personal data it handles, people familiar with the matter said.The Chinese technology company is seeking to provide assurances to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) that personal data held by TikTok, which is widely popular with U.S. teenagers, is stored securely in the United States and will not be compromised by Chinese authorities, the sources said.CFIUS, which reviews deals by foreign acquirers for potential national security risks, is looking into ByteDance\u2019s $1 billion acquisition of social media app Musical.ly in 2017, which laid the foundations for TikTok\u2019s rapid growth, Reuters reported earlier this month.ByteDance\u2019s response represents a key test of corporate China\u2019s ability to operate businesses in the United States that handle personal data, as U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with China fans suspicion between the world\u2019s two largest economies.ByteDance is hoping to avoid the fate of Chinese gaming company Beijing Kunlun Tech Co Ltd, which said in May it would agree to a CFIUS request to divest popular gay dating app Grindr following concerns about the security of personal data. It is also exploring exiting its investment in Grindr through an initial public offering.ByteDance started to separate TikTok operationally before CFIUS approached it in October, because it wanted some of its staff to focus on TikTok, according to the sources.It completed the separation of TikTok\u2019s product and business development, marketing and legal teams from those of its Chinese social media app Douyin in the third quarter of this year, according to the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss the company\u2019s internal arrangements.During the summer, it also hired an external consultant to carry out audits on the integrity of the personal data it stores, the sources added. The company has said U.S. user data is stored entirely in the United States, with a backup in Singapore. It has also said that the Chinese government does not have any jurisdiction over TikTok content.Following the approach by CFIUS, TikTok is making a new push to set up a team in Mountain View, California, that will oversee data management, according to the sources. This team will determine whether Chinese-based engineers should have access to TikTok\u2019s database, and monitor their activity, the sources said.TikTok is also hiring more U.S. engineers to reduce its reliance on staff in China, according to the sources.It is not clear how effective these changes will be in appeasing CFIUS. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Treasury Department, which chairs CFIUS, said it does not comment on information relating to specific CFIUS cases.\u201cShifting a company\u2019s operations away from China, geographically and technically, can give CFIUS more comfort that the company is really independent of its Chinese owner and the Chinese government,\u201d said Nevena Simidjiyska, a partner at law firm Fox Rothschild LLP who advises companies on CFIUS reviews and is not involved in the TikTok case.TikTok employs about 400 people in the United States, up from 20 people at the time of the Musical.ly acquisition, the sources said. Most of the new employees joined this year, as TikTok built its U.S. operations, the sources added. ByteDance has 50,000 employees around the world.U.S. lawmakers called last month for a national security probe into TikTok, expressing concern that the Chinese company may be censoring politically sensitive content, and raising questions about how it stores personal data. Last week, U.S. Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy said the U.S. military is undertaking a security assessment of TikTok.Facebook Inc CEO Mark Zuckerberg, whose social media platform competes with TikTok for younger users, has also criticised the app over censorship concerns.The CFIUS probe is currently focused on the handling of personal data, rather than censorship, according to two of the sources. ByteDance views the CFIUS investigation as informal, and has not yet been subjected to an official review, one of the sources added.Some of the personal data that TikTok stores, such as a person\u2019s name, age, email address and phone number, is submitted by its users. Other information, related to a person\u2019s location, is collected automatically, according to TikTok\u2019s website. TikTok also stores user-generated content, such as photographs and videos.Launched just two years ago, TikTok has been downloaded 1.5 billion times, making it the third most downloaded non-gaming app of the year, after Facebook\u2019s WhatsApp and Messenger apps, according to research firm SensorTower.ByteDance is one of China\u2019s fastest growing start-ups. It owns the country\u2019s leading news aggregator, Jinri Toutiao, as well as TikTok, which has attracted celebrities like Ariana Grande and Katy Perry.ByteDance counts Japanese technology giant SoftBank Group Corp, venture capital firm Sequoia Capital, and private equity firms such as KKR & Co Inc, General Atlantic and Hillhouse Capital Group as backers.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nRed Bull River Runes contest set-up\n | Photo Credit: \nDivya Kala Bhavani\n As one nears Hyderabad International Convention Centre, the ground throbs with excitement and the flags peppering the lanes leading to India Game Developer Conference (IGDC), ripple in the wind. Inside the convention hall are behemoth screens, shifting light shows and hundreds of smiling people bustling around.IGDC was formerly known as NASSCOM Game Developers Conference; it went under a re-branding given the international pull of the conference. Much like the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco and ChinaJoy in Shanghai, there are exclusive opportunities for gamers, whatever the scale of their interest.The conference provided meet-cues between investors and gaming developers across the country and most of them took the form of immersive panels which included \u2018Strategies for finding and vetting good partners for your company\u2019 with Jay Powell and \u2018Indian Market - Status Quo\u2019 which featured Shubh Malhotra of MPL Gaming, Shalu Jhunjhunwala of Google and Vikash Jaiswal of Gametion, among others. \n\n\n\n\n\nPencils & Pixels\u2019 Traditional C Digital Art Competition\n\n| Photo Credit: \nDivya Kala Bhavani  \n\n\n\n\nOne of the attendees, Vijay K N, a future game designer, says he found the Indian Market - Status Quo panel quite riveting. \u201cI wanted to know the realistic hurdles coming my way. In the creative industry, it is more important to know the business side of things so that you don\u2019t get taken advantage of. There are still cases where game designers or studios have unwittingly handed over their property without seeing the legal side of it properly. \u201d Talks such as this also lay the foundation for jargon and help the creatives stay in tune with the headlines in their industry without feeling overwhelmed.A particularly packed seminar was a fireside chat with Vishnu Cherikkandi of Tencent Games. One of the platform\u2019s creations \u2014 a little thing called PUBG \u2014 created quite a stir this year with its continual antagonism with India\u2019s courts and concerned parents alike. Not many people realise India is a major centre for the performance capture and motion capture we see in major games including Hitman, Control and Borderlands 3. Companies such as Hyderabad-based Firebolt Entertainment and Mumbai-based Centroid Motion Capture drew quite a few young hopefuls around career goals and even just inside knowledge on their favourite experiences. Centroid director Parth Shah is excited to bring the studio from London and Belgium to India finally where thousands of talented people can get in on the back-end development of gaming. \u201cIt\u2019s time the world knows India is where it\u2019s at!\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\nTwo attendees play Red Dead Redemption 2 \n| Photo Credit: \nDivya Kala Bhavani  \n\n\n\n\nClearly, democracy in the access to gaming tools was very much on the agenda at IGDC 2019, and much in agreement with this is Quentin Staes-Polet of Epic Games, the studio behind the well-known Unreal Engine and games such as Fortnite and Paragon. Having worked in the gaming industry for almost 10 years, he is all about creating new connections between the Indian market and Unreal Engine, a suite of integrated tools for game developers to design and build games. \u201cIt\u2019s time to start supporting this big group of Indian gaming developers. Unreal will also make up a big part of Epic Games\u2019 education scheme. Because of Fortnite\u2019s global growth, we are ready to find the many developers out there, who are ready to work with AI and Machine Learning. We\u2019ve seen so many developers with other approaches to design. Yes, it\u2019s a competitive market and access to distribution is unequal. We want to make it less expensive for those who have ideas to develop their ideas at a low cost but still get a good result.\u201d League Of Legends fanatics leaned into Jayson Keyser\u2019s talk \u2018From VFX to Creation\u2019 which details the exhaustive world of designing open-world games with precision and skill. \u201cVFX comprises an evolving formula and you keep building on it. The quality of the developers makes the quality of the final result; League Of Legends has had a four-year working cycle. But I\u2019ve got to say, one of my pet peeves in game design is when the frame rate drops.\u201d Jayson heads up California-based VFX Apprentice where he\u2019s an educator and artist.It is worth noting that IGDC did not have many people posed with their phones in the air for selfies. Unlike Comic Con India, there is no cosplay; here, people mean business \u2014 especially in competitive e-sports. NODWIN Esports Arena held one corner of the colourful room where the ESL India Premiership \u2013 Fall Finale was taking place. Were it not for the powerful air conditioning, everyone, including spectators, would be drenched in stress-sweat. Out of the end of this gruelling competition came four winners: Samith for Clash Royale \u2013 8Bit Smoke, SynerGE Retribution for Brawl Stars, Global Esports for DOTA 2, Orgless5ive for CSGO. \n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the players at the Red Bull River Runes contest \n| Photo Credit: \nDivya Kala Bhavani  \n\n\n\n\nOne of the most popular games in the industry, Tom Clancy\u2019s Rainbow 6 Siege India Series, had a competition too, and the winner was Vector Sports. But no one in the premises could miss the huge Red Bull River Runes contest which saw G.E. Micro (Sahil Kishor Viradia) take the trophy home.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe set-up for the e-sports session for Tom Clancy\u2019s Rainbow 6 Siege India Series, \n| Photo Credit: \nDivya Kala Bhavani  \n\n\n\n\nPencils & Pixels also had young graphic designers and animators competing in Traditional C Digital Art while there were also opportunities for offline competitions such as plasticine-moulding or even with popular board games. \n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the offline competitions saw a participant creating The Last Stag from Hollow Knight \n| Photo Credit: \nDivya Kala Bhavani  \n\n\n\n\nRajesh Rao is the mastermind behind NGDC and IGDC. Having been chairperson at NASSCOM Gaming Forum for 11 years as well as founder at Dhruva Interactive, it is fair to say Rajesh is on the pulse of what people want in regards to gaming, not just what\u2019s hot in the industry. In an interview ahead of the conference, he shares, \u201cHyderabad is a great location because the Government of Telangana is really supportive in their recognition of gaming and visual effects as real industries. Seeing the build-up, I just wish I were 25 and starting now! Being an entrepreneur in this space is exciting; back in my day, we struggled and there was no business cases to it, it was purely passion-driven. Everything is lining up now; there are more resources and newer technologies.\u201d This year\u2019s IGDC saw over 3000 people in attendance and more than 200 industry speakers. From here on, as Rajesh says, it is only upwards.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nA sample screenshot of Pixelfed\u2019s interface\n | Photo Credit: \nPixelfed.org  Mastodon is not done making headlines. One November 26, the open-source and federated platform announced, via Twitter, that they would be launching Pixelfed, \u201ca fediverse alternative to Instagram and other photo sharing platforms.\u201d Tacked on the end of the tweet is the hashtag #TheFutureIsFederated.The tweet is a quote-tweet from the Pixelfed The only form of explanation comes in a teaser video. \u201cWhat is the fediverse? It\u2019s magic. A platform for the people. And we mean everyone. We\u2019ll be arriving soon! Power to the people. Pixelfed.org,\u201d says the video.\n\n\nIt's magic. #pixelfed #fediverse pic.twitter.com/8m9myWjrs7\u2014 Pixelfed (@PixelFed) November 26, 2019 \n\n\nIt's magic. #pixelfed #fediverse pic.twitter.com/8m9myWjrs7The website for Pixelfed displays a basic outline for the to-be-released platform. Much like Mastodon, it promises to be free of ads, with chronological timelines with no interference from algorithms and privacy-focussed in that there will be no third party analytics or tracking. Essentially, Pixelfed gives netizens the power to the ability to run your own site that links up to all the others to form a large collection (or federation) of sites.In terms of privacy, Pixelfed has two-factor authentication systems, account logs, the ability to block accounts, potential to connect devices, a help centre. Similar to Instagram, one can also mute accounts, privatise your own account, make certain posts private, file reports against anti-guideline posts and one can even unlist posts. You can also block accounts, disable comments, hide follower counts, set up content warnings for more sensitive or triggering posts.\n\n\n\n\n\nPixelfed\u2019s logo \n| Photo Credit: \nPixelfed.org\n \n\n\n\n\nThe design interface also looks quite similar to Instagram with the ability to \u2018heart\u2019, comment and share posts, as well as a Discover tab to reach out to other content creators on the site. However, unlike Instagram \u2014 who may not be affected much by this \u2014 and like Mastodon there\u2019s no singular eponymous app... though the logo looks amusingly similar to that of Picasa by Google. The Documentation section of the site disclaims, \u201cPixelfed is still a work in progress. We do not recommending running an instance in production at this stage unless you know what you are doing!\u201dBrowse the official website and one will notice Pixelfed\u2019s first blog post was dated April 27 of this year, however on October 26, a blog post titled \u2018Urgent security issue...\u2019 stated, \u201cWe have become aware of a new security risk that has emerged within the past few days. This exploit is bad...\u201dIt is important to note that this isn't an issue with the Pixelfed software, but with a web and PHP server combination (nginx and php-fpm) that some people running instances of Pixelfed might be using, and since people can host their own instances of Pixelfed. Basically, this blog post, serving as a public service announcement, was made to inform those people as it affects many websites running that combination of software. Hopefully, these security measures in the coding and back-end of the platform have been ironed out.A simple Google search of Pixelfed also brings up forum-based discussions, too. One particular forum from 8 months ago at YCombinator.com dissects the possibilities of what Pixelfed would mean. One user in the forum discussion mentioned, \u201cTo be fair, Pixelfed is in its early shoes.

      "\nThe team of boys from St Joseph Academy  Excitement writ large on their faces, their eagerness to show what they designed was palpable.They were also thrilled at the thought of getting to play a game or two. At the India Game Developer Conference (IGDC), teams of young participants came to demonstrate the games they had created. Standing behind their desks, dressed in their school uniform, Shreyash Laxmi Narayan, Mihir Rao and Rushil Yadav, the VIII Std students of Shiv Nadar School in Gurugram explain their game \u2018Dimensions switch\u2019, which begins with a question, \u2018Who will save the world now?\u2019 Once you select \u2018I will\u2019 the player enters. The trio took part in a design championship with the game as they wanted to try something new after trying different design applications like Scratch (a free programming language for use in creating interactive stories, games, and animations) and MID. It was their first game, and the trio says it took them two weeks to develop it. Do they love technology? \u201cYes, very much,\u201d pat came the reply in unison. \u201cThis is our first opportunity and we feel really excited to see so many other gamers under one roof. Hoping to meet and speak to some game developers to understand how they work on different programs,\u201d says Mihir Rao. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe team of boys from Shiv Nadar School Gurgaon. (L-R: Rushil Yadav, Mihir Rao, Shreyansh Lakshmi Narayan)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Mihir speaks, Rushil and Shreyansh prepare for a demo of the game and explain, \u201cWe use fire and ice against each other as a weapon to get into the next dimension.\u201d They are now looking to go back and see how to make it into different stages and let their friends try it.Standing next to them is a team of students from St Joseph\u2019s Academy, Ooty, Tamil Nadu. The four boys, Kim Eldon, F Fazil, Harish Balaji and Mohammed Saif studying in VII std take turns to explain the different aspects of the game and the way they developed it. They reveal that they attended and won at the design championship so they created a game called Miniscule for IGDC. The single-player game involves 31 bullets and 21 enemies. The idea of the game was perceived by Harish and Fazil and the characters were designed by Kim and Fazil using C Sharp coding. The game is in two design stages in which player can revive themself after almost meeting their end.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "The rising popularity of Tamil YouTube",
      "Updated: November 29, 2019 10:04 IST\rPublished: November 26, 2019 14:06 IST",

      "\nYouTube creators at the Pop-UP space in Chennai\n | Photo Credit: \nSpecial Arrangement\n We have all watched Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX defy the laws of logic with its innovating concepts like reusable boosters (the ones that return to land after launching a rocket instead of diving into the sea).But what if someone told you the basic principle behind this technology is similar to balancing a stick on your index finger (aligning the object\u2019s mass in line with its centre of gravity)?Breaking down complex concepts into easily graspable bits of science in the Tamil language is what Premanand Sethurajan\u2019s YouTube channel, Let\u2019s Make Engineering Simple (LMES), is adept at. When he started on YouTube, almost five years ago, videos by LMES hardly received 100 views. Today, the average viewership is upwards of 1.5 lakh. At over 9 lakh users, the channel\u2019s subscription base too has grown substantially.The case is similar with Nakkalites, a popular Tamil language entertainment channel on YouTube. Founded by Prasanna Balachandran and 27-year-old visual communication graduate, Rajeshwar K, Nakkalites currently boast a subscription count north of two million. Almost all of their videos earn an average views count of one million.The immense growth in popularity of Tamil language YouTube channels has not gone unnoticed by the California-based video sharing platform, which recently organised a YouTube Pop-Up space in Chennai, where it invited hundreds of content creators to collaborate and create videos while sharing information on their processes. \u201cIn 2018, we had only 30 Tamil creators who had crossed the one-million subscriber mark, but in less than a year, this number has grown to 94,\u201d says Satya Raghavan, director, YouTube content partnerships.\n\n\n\n\n\n(extreme left) Satya Raghavan, director, YouTube content partnerships, with Tamil language YouTube content creators\n\n| Photo Credit: \nSpecial Arrangement\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThrough Pop-Up, we want to continue to invest in growth of creators and handhold aspiring ones to learn from the creator community,\u201d he adds. LMES was not a direct beneficiary of Pop-Up spaces through its formative years, but, adds Premanand, the event allows content creators like him to meet new people, and even opens up cross-collaboration opportunities.While one of YouTube\u2019s revenue share models suggests that it splits 55% of advertising revenue with creators, channels like LMES have now outgrown the platform. \u201cI cannot sustain the company with just the ad-share revenue model from YouTube,\u201d says Premanand, who has recently launched a learning app and hosts workshops and events in collaboration with schools and other educational institutions.Nakkalites, too, has organically managed to grow to a level where it can resist corporate overtures, the kind that saw channels like Put Chutney being absorbed into content creation umbrella firms like Culture Machine. \u201cWe have received a lot of investment opportunities over the years but we turned them all away because we cannot work with complete freedom once we enter into such an arrangement,\u201d explains Rajeshwar.\n\n\n\n\n\nYouTube creators at the Pop-UP space in Chennai\n\n| Photo Credit: \nSpecial Arrangement\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAnd that has been the key for their growth. Nakkalites boasts a family audience for its content, and grabs eyeballs for videos that are \u201crooted to reality and has a regional flavour,\u201d Rajeshwar adds.The four-day event saw more than 500 content creators participate, of which, says Raghavan, more than 50% were non-Chennaiites, pointing at the significance of Internet penetration in tier-II and tier-III cities as well as in rural Tamil Nadu. \u201cWith every passing year, newer cities have emerged as centres of excellence. Content in languages like Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam are doing really well,\u201d he adds.Big DataOf the 460 million Internet users in India in 2019, at least 265 million visit or access YouTube on a monthly basis.India adds nearly 40 million new Internet users every year. All of them are expected to log on to YouTube at least once after going online; of these, more than 60% of the new users are not located in India\u2019s six metropolitan cities.There are 1,200 Indian channels with over one million subscribers. Of these, 120 channels are run by women content creators.There are 94 Tamil channels at the moment, with over one million subscribers each. As many as 1,250 Tamil channels have between 1,00,000 and one million subscribers.The possibility of increased engagement via YouTube also reflects in standard practices adopted by Tamil cinema as well. For over a year now, filmmakers have attempted the two or three-trailer strategy, as Raghavan puts it, where the producers create buzz on social media platforms through motion posters, teasers and trailers uploaded to YouTube. \u201cThe engagement that our movie partners get on their trailers has a high correlation with their box office yields,\u201d he adds.There is, of course, an element of misuse (with fake or misleading content) that comes into play when both the platform and the supply chain grows exponentially and at a much faster rate. The problem of fake or misleading content is an issue, especially when such content can reach and influence Internet-empowered new age citizens of this country, who would be going online for the first time in 2020 and beyond. More than hate speech or the inclusion of profanity, it is the whataboutery in such content \u2014 something that channels like Premanand\u2019s have been waging a battle against \u2014 that can undermine the growth of Tamil language content.\u201cYouTube\u2019s genesis is that it is an open platform. Our thing is not about censorship. Having said that, we have very strong community guidelines, and we also work with the respective Governments to maintain the law of the land,\u201d Raghavan adds.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "This Indian-made book has a chapter written by Artificial Intelligence ",
      "Updated: November 28, 2019 16:12 IST\rPublished: November 25, 2019 17:13 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/jaspreet-bindra-the-tech-whisperer-interview-2019/article30076761.ece",
      "In the 1950s, the fathers of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Marvin Minsky and John McCarthy loosely defined AI as \u201cany task performed by a program or a machine that, if a human carried out the same activity, we would say the human had to apply intelligence to accomplish the task.\u201d Where did we find this nugget of tech history? From a chapter written by AI on AI. Yes, you read that right. Adding to the list of AI achievements, including AI composing music and creating paintings, this would perhaps be the first time in publishing history that AI writes about itself.In a detailed summary of Jaspreet Bindra\u2019s The Tech Whisperer: On Digital Transformation and the Technologies that Enable It (Penguin India, \u20b9599), AI has analysed, among other questions, whether it will replace livelihoods or create jobs, whether it will create a more humane society or an amoral world. On the surface, it is hard to tell if an AI or a human being wrote the chapter because the writing combines logic, facts, and structure. On in-depth reading (which was done to nitpick, to support the argument that AI can never replace humans), what was found wanting was a person\u2019s humane, conversational voice and descriptive style that makes a piece of writing a joy to read. The chapter was packed with facts, but is that enough to make it worth a read? That is a subjective question. The idea behind creating an AI engine to write, however, is definitely innovative.\n\n\n\n\n\nJaspreet, an expert on digital transformation, blockchain, and other emerging technologies, says, \u201cThe idea came to me when I was watching the video on how IBM\u2019s Project Debater competed against debating champion Harish Natarajan. This followed other man-versus-machine contests: Deep Blue defeating chess champion Garry Kasparov, Watson defeating Jeopardy! champions Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings, AlphaGo developed by Google DeepMind destroying Lee Sedol the undefeated champion of the strategy game Go... AI has also painted, created music... but, in my knowledge, had not yet published a chapter in a book! It was then that I thought what if AI can write on AI, on itself?\u201dTo explore this possibility, Jaspreet got in touch with Anand Mahurkar, CEO of Findability Sciences, a Boston-based AI company. \u201cThe team built an AI engine which could write about itself.\u201d Jaspreet describes the process of how the engine was built. \u201cFindability Sciences used a product called FP-Summary\u2122 which is an innovative unsupervised method for automatic sentence extraction using proprietary algorithms, to crunch reams of unstructured data on AI that I gave it (from Wikipedia, etc), and created a full 37 page chapter on itself!\u201dThe rest of the book is not just meant for tech nerds, it is even for those who have hardly any knowledge or real interest in technology. \u201cIt is a book for everyone \u2014 digital practitioners as well as the many people who are intrigued/fascinated by technology, but are also a little scared by it.\u201dThe book also goes in-depth about companies that are looking to keep pace with rapid digital transformation. Even tech giants such as Apple and Microsoft (written extensively about in the book) have had to re-invent themselves in the face of digital transformation. \u201cThe book is divided into two parts. The first is largely focussed on corporate management and employees who want to bring technology into their company. This part focusses on defining digital transformation, describing what it is, and detailing practically how companies can make this happen. The second part demystifies and simplifies complex technology, including Artificial Intelligence (AI), blockchain, Internet of Things, virtual reality, among others.\u201d Even though the Internet has an abundance of articles on technology that you can skim through, the depth and the clarity with which Jaspreet has written about emerging technology provides a more nuanced understanding.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn why he calls himself the tech whisperer, Jaspreet says, \u201cJust as there are horse and dog whisperers, I am a tech whisperer, who has specialised knowledge for companies to engage with technological transformation. I do realise that it is a cacophonous world we live in. We look at our phone more than 2,000 times every day, to try and take in the half a million tweets, the 100,000 Instagram photos, 50 million WhatsApp messages which are sent every minute. Then there are the videos, the old and new social networks, the emails, and somewhere in the middle of all of this, a human being who actually wants to talk to you! As each of them tries to grab your attention, they try and shout louder and louder, they blink, they pop out, they transform themselves to emojis. I believe that a whisper can be heard far more loudly than a scream. Therefore, I have dredged into my experience to collect all these whispers.\u201dAs for whether AI will replace human beings, Jaspreet says that prediction is too extreme. \u201cAI will make some jobs redundant: jobs which are repetitive and mechanical \u2014 like data entry operators, paralegals, etc. However, as the Chinese AI guru Kai-Fu Lee posits, the jobs with high creativity and high compassion will remain and grow.\u201d In fact, the 272-page book explores how AI might be effective in creating alternative jobs in place of redundant ones.Jaspreet is quite the innovator, even when it comes to launching his book. In the Delhi launch, there was an AI painting and in Chennai, Jaspreet says, \u201cThe launch will be on November 29 at The Raintree, Anna Salai, at 4 pm. We are planning a quiz with Gaurav Sri Krishna... which will feature an AI.\u201d Only time will tell if humans will win the intelligence game.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "Turn up the heat with 'Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order' and 'Need For Speed: Heat'",

      "https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/gamespot-review-star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-need-for-speed-heat/article30076675.ece",
      "Yes, this week, it\u2019s all about the two universes that have had our controllers jockeying for a binge-session....Star Wars has always been about flashy Jedis, weird aliens and cute robots. And the newest droid on the block is BD-1. The energetic and agile BD-1 doubles as a chic, talkative backpack that dispenses healing items. It is one of the best parts of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order.The game is set after Revenge of the Sith, in the aftermath of Order 66, which saw the Empire purge all Jedis. Cal Kestis is a refugee hiding in a scrapyard of a planet when the purge comes knocking at his door. A chance rescue throws him on a mission that could resurrect the fallen order of Jedis.Star Wars Jedi: Fallen OrderDeveloper: Respawn EntertainmentPublisher: Electronic ArtsPrice: \u20b93499 for the PlayStation 4, PC, Xbox OneThe mission takes you across the galaxy with the crew of the Mantis. The colourful cast brings the typical Star Wars feel, with the exception of Cal, who sounds bored in all scenarios with zero charisma. Cal\u2019s character tries very much to be a young Nathan Drake but comes up short. It is the worst part of the game.Fallen Order is about discovery and combat. The slide-and-jump sequences whilst exploring reminds you of the Lara Croft series. The levels are designed like a metroidvania game with certain areas locked until you get new powers. The lightsaber combat is very Sekiro-inspired, with aggressive duels with Stormtroopers and massive aliens. While it is not as tough as a Souls game, it still is challenging. Fallen Order is a mix of game types that work surprisingly well together.\n\n\n\n\n\nFallen Order looks like a big-budget Star Wars movie, from the massive set pieces to superb sound. Technically, it is marred by a lot of glitches and ibugs. It is easy to veer off the path and finding the nearest shortcut is tedious in the byzantine levels.We have waited long for an excellent Star Wars game and now finally we get one with the lightsaber straight out of the movies and some incredible sequences.The last few years have not been good for the Need for Speed series. So it is understandable why Heat, the latest Need for Speed game, had a quiet launch. Yet, Heat is far from the duds of the past and, in fact, harks back to the 2000s, when the first The Fast and the Furious movie made street racing cool.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou play a new racer who has come to Palm City, a hotbed of street racing. To tackle the menace, a rogue police force turns up the heat on errant speedsters. You have to fight your way up the ranks to be the best. And, you need to tolerate the terrible story and hammy voice-acting.Need for Speed: HeatDeveloper: Ghost GamesPublisher: Electronic ArtsPrice: \u20b93499 for the PlayStation 4, PC, Xbox OneThe way to the top is earning rep and the best rewards come with risk. While you can take part in sanctioned events during the day, the real beasts come out to play at night. Palm City looks gorgeous, clad in neon. And, you earn money and rep winning exhilarating races, wherein you are always a hairpin turn away from getting busted. But the risks are worth the rewards as you get some cool upgrades and clothes.The game gets tough with physics-defying cars and cops who seem to bust you in seconds. Heat does not play fair at times. Thankfully, the cars are good. Once you get a hang of the drifting and handling, you can use the environment to outsmart the AI.While Heat looks and plays excellent, the street racing genre that peaked in Need For Speed: Most Wanted feels dated. Even the Fast and the Furious movies pivoted around heists. While it admirably tries to resuscitate the culture, it succeeds in taking you on a ride down memory lane.\n\n\n\n\n\nElectronic Arts has got two hits, which it badly needed, with Need for Speed: Heat and Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. It seems as though the gaming giant is back on track.The writer is a tech and gaming enthusiast who hopes to one day finish his sci-fi novel\nWhy you should pay for quality journalism - Click to know more"

She has experience brokering millions of dollars in deals for product placement and integrated branding campaigns across digital and traditional media, and works with top agencies and brands in verticals ranging from beauty and lifestyle to consumer products. In an exclusive interaction with The Hindu Weekend, she breaks down what influencers need to know to safeguard their work.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeanne Perice \n\n\n\n\n\nBefore signing off on any deal, I negotiate the usage rights for my clients according to the general scope of work. I take several factors into consideration, such as the contact term length, exclusivity, deliverables, and talent fee. Based on this, I am able to determine the appropriate usage. The usage is where a lot of security concerns come into play. If you don\u2019t understand usage rights, your content can be used however the brand wants \u2014 and if you\u2019re granting a brand access to your social media channels, a lot of information is at stake.As Instagram and social media in general grows, influencers are only reaching a fraction of their audience they worked so hard to grow: this is referred to as organic reach. Naturally, when a brand is partnering with talent, they want to ensure that content is being seen by as many people as possible. This is when a brand will put additional budget to \u2018whitelist\u2019 or \u2018boost\u2019 an influencer campaign so it reaches a bigger audience. My role is to educate my clients and the brands we work with on best practices in this emerging space.I work closely with a company called Lumanu, who specialize in influencer media. They believe in a fair and transparent industry where creators deserve to know how their content, likeness, and data are being used. SocialCert provides influencers with tools that help to control what data is shared with brand partners. Influencers can manage the sharing of usage rights, such as allowing partners to use content in other channels or to boost posts. It\u2019s a brilliant company whose mission I am very aligned with. They\u2019re way ahead of the curve.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days. Already have an account ?

      "Meet the strategists behind your favourite social media stars ",

      "\n(Clockwise from top left) Sumedh Chaphekar of NoFiltr, TikTok star Mrunal Panchal, veteran influencer Santoshi Shetty, the Spothlete team, Ankit Agarwal of DYT, hijabi weightlifter Majiziya Bhanu, Apaksh Gupta of One Impression and hockey player Yuvraj Walmiki  | Photo Credit: \nSpecial Arrangement  Hockey player Yuvraj Walmiki rose through the ranks to represent India at the 2014 World Cup. He has since fallen out of favour with selectors of the national team, but has kept busy playing for the Indian Railways and German leagues, taking part in a reality show, and being an Instagram influencer. With around 1.2 lakh followers, the 30-year-old is now a New Balance-sponsored athlete, apart from endorsing sports-related gear like Noise Shots Bluetooth headphones and a nutrition brand.But you can\u2019t put it all down to Walmiki\u2019s popularity. That credit goes to the Pune-based team at influencer marketing platform, Spothlete. Since the influencer boom in 2015, the task of these platforms has evolved from merely connecting brands with influencers (to help reach their target audience), to discussing content and creating strategies for how influencers approach their work. \u201cWe direct them on how to best present the brand in a creative way, both visually and with the accompanying content,\u201d says co-founder Prateek Goyal.\n\n\n\n\n\n The influencer economy, especially in India, is in the midst of a flux. Social media platforms are constantly tweaking their algorithms to decide the type of content they assume consumers want to see (although, all we want is the chronological timeline on Instagram back!). Brands are also looking at a shared ethos, engagements over number of likes, and quality of content over quantity of followers. So macro and micro influencers need to stand out in a crowded playing field.These are the services that influencer marketing platforms are extending. The focus is on helping the new wave of influencers (especially from tier 2 and tier 3 cities), with the basics of marketing themselves. For instance, YouTuber Angry Prash\u2019s strategy was tweaked when he signed up with Mumbai-based NoFiltr. In 2017, he\u2019d started a rant channel featuring comics made on MS Paint. Within a couple of months, he got 50,000 subscribers. \u201cAt around 1 lakh subscribers, I signed up with NoFiltr. After strategising, we decided to take things offline to engage with the audience more. I also introduced my [now signature] bird-shaped helmet to maintain my anonymity,\u201d says the 23-year-old, who presently clocks in at 3.1 million subscribers on YouTube, and has worked with Tinder, SkillShare and Amazon, among other brands.\n\n\n\n\n\nCEO Sumedh Chaphekar says he looks at NoFiltr as a human incubator of sorts. \u201cWe find early-stage influencers \u2014 someone who has managed around 10,000+ followers. It means they are on to something, and are ready to put in the work,\u201d he says. Once they are signed on (at no charge), they undergo an intensive planning session. \u201cWe cover everything from childhood experience to current aspirations, and then paint a roadmap that draws from these narratives and amplifies their character,\u201d he says. A strategy is created for every platform. Do HNIs (high networth individuals) approach them, to help them build up a following? Chaphekar says yes, but they don\u2019t take such projects on. Tech can often be overwhelming for potential influencers. So, not only do these platforms break down personal analytics \u2014 to show which age group or location is working for them \u2014 but they also use data and artificial intelligence tools to make content. At Chtrbox, CEO-co-founder Pranay Swarup says, \u201cWe analyse the public content of over three lakh Indian influencers and, based on this, come up with campaigns.\u201dAll the platforms featured in this article have built their own analytical software in-house, and rely on them for a host of decisions. But in August, Chtrbox went public with their data, with the launch of Boombox, an open discovery tool of India\u2019s most influential voices. This is meant to help marketers shortlist relevant celebrities in an easier, more informed manner, even if they are not clients. So, if a brand is looking to collaborate on Instagram with a stand-up comic, they\u2019ll find that Kapil Sharma has the highest reach at 18 million, but only a 2.79% engagement rate. Whereas Beast Boy Shub \u2014 a 22-year-old who puts a humorous spin on gaming \u2014 has a massive engagement rate of 32.07% with a reach of 72,600. Brands can take a call on whom to work with based on what they want out of the campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe platforms don\u2019t charge influencers for coming on board; most take a percentage of the brand\u2019s commission. For example, at One Impression, the team matches registered influencers with potential clients, and the platform gets a 10% commission on the completed project. \u201cWe create content at scale, mapping the influencers\u2019 audience with the brand\u2019s target audience,\u201d says founder-CEO Apaksh Gupta, adding that they screen their clients, looking at engagement rates and who they\u2019ve worked with in the past.Ankit Agarwal\u2019s three-month-old app-based platform, Do Your Thng (DYT), takes a slightly different approach. \u201cWe work even with those who have smaller followings, as long as they are willing to create content. Based on the campaigns, we connect their creations to the appropriate brands,\u201d he says. Guidelines, deliverables and mandatory hashtags are supplied, and selected content is awarded credits that can be redeemed as cash. The platform is also the official media partner for the ongoing InfluencerCon in Hyderabad, which he sees as an opportunity to grow their numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile lifestyle, fashion, travel, tech and food are the leading topics, sports influencers are the fastest growing category. And we\u2019re not talking just big names like cricketer Virat Kohli or badminton star Saina Nehwal. On a platform like Spothlethe, you will find hijabi weightlifter Majiziya Bhanu, three-time Deaflympic gold medallist Virender Singh, and national road racing and rally champion Aishwarya Pissay. They have a dedicated audience that is interested in the sport, and, as Goyal puts it, \u201cThe engagement rates can be as high as 20%.\u201d Keep in mind, this rate is around 4.42% for Kohli and 4.38% for Nehwal.Founder of the platform, Piyush Sharma, was a budding cricketer who made it to the Ranji team, but discontinued the game. He met Goyal at IIT Kanpur and the two went on to launch a site called KreedOn, dedicated to stories of Indian sportspersons. \u201cSpothlete was a natural extension of this,\u201d says Goyal. \u201cThese athletes were anyway posting images and videos based on their sport. So why not monetise it? We help curate the content and captions.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the past year, there have been grim tidings for this economy. Media reports indicate that a certain disdain has crept into conversations around influencers, with their authenticity often being called into question. Business Insider reported how Instagrammers are scamming followers by flaunting wealth they didn\u2019t have. In August, BBC described the furore around a biking influencer\u2019s post on being involved in an accident, which later turned out to be staged.Governments are taking note, setting in place disclosure guidelines to ensure that posts are accompanied by #sponsored or #ad. As for the popularity charts, Facebook and Instagram are rolling out plans to hide the overall number of likes, to reduce the importance given to these stats. The platforms state that the latter won\u2019t affect the marketing side of things because creators can still access their analytics. As for the bigger picture, Chaphekar says the worst-case scenario for them would be that their star clients get big enough to hire their own teams. He adds that there will always be newer platforms and newer influencers \u2014 \u201cIt is a constantly evolving space, and to survive, both we and the influencers have to be willing to do what it takes to stay relevant.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "Why people are glued to their phones watching video after video on YouTube",
      "Updated: November 23, 2019 21:17 IST\rPublished: November 22, 2019 16:39 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/why-people-are-glued-to-their-phones-watching-video-after-video-on-youtube/article30050759.ece",
      "\nA cover of Sia\u2019s \u2018Chandelier\u2019 in the voice of Mario character Toad.\n As 2019 \u2014 arguably the longest year of all time \u2014 reaches its termination, it brings with it one of those riddle-like questions that people somehow get very confused about. Does the decade finish in 2019 or 2020? The majority of people have agreed amongst themselves that we\u2019re entering the last month of the 2010s, after which a new decade begins: the 20s, or the 2020s.But there\u2019s also a small, loud, and wrong minority convinced that we have another year to go. For the sake of both convenience and accuracy, I\u2019m going with the popular vote here \u2014 the decade ends in a month and a few days. It\u2019s the standard birth principle: the day you\u2019re born is not your first but your zero\u2019th birthday. The same rule applies here.Anyway, eight years ago, I chanced upon a curious little video during a YouTube spiral \u2014 where you open the website to watch one video and end up spending 13 hours on it. Called \u2018Talking Animals,\u2019 it was a series of clips from a BBC documentary. The video, parts of which still exist on the Internet, was basically just a collection of different animals doing their thing in the wild, with an English voice-over adding uproarious dialogues and a narrative to the seemingly random actions on screen. It was possibly the funniest thing I saw that year, and for many years after.Then, a couple of weeks ago, I found a YouTube video of a musician covering a song by Australian singer Sia, called \u2018Chandelier\u2019. So far, so ho-hum. Except that it\u2019s sung in the toddlerish, helium-inflected voice of a Mario character called Toad. It\u2019s a toad singing! And it is out of this world. I dare you to not crack up till you have tears flying off your face when the high-pitched chorus hits.This is really what YouTube is. It\u2019s memorable in the most outlandish of ways. Over the past few years, video (and audio) streaming platforms have taken over our consciousness. Netflix (and pirated streaming websites that keep changing their URL) opened the floodgates, and now we have a range of others as well, each with its own splendid collection ranging from trashy TV to water-cooler documentaries to artsy-fartsy cinema. But like Tendulkar refusing to retire for all those years, YouTube persists. It entered our lives some 15 years ago, but \u2014 in India, especially \u2014 it\u2019s only over the last few years, since the now-erstwhile telecom boom, that it\u2019s caught our fancy in a big enough way. The fact that it still has a free version and comes pre-installed in most smartphones helps a great deal, tilting the balance in its favour.Walk into the real world on any given day \u2014 maybe take the metro or a local bus \u2014 and people of all shapes are glued to their phones watching free video after free video on YouTube. My nephew watches cartoons on it, my parents use it for cooking recipes, I watch on loop that video of two Indians cursing each other loudly in broken English on a foreign street before parting ways with a kind greeting and wave.I have found new albums uploaded under false names a day before their actual release, sped up to 1.5 times the actual speed, which you then slow down and listen to. I\u2019ve watched live, newsy events. Entire pirated movies. Live concerts from before cameras were invented. Grainy footage of historic sporting events. Premieres of songs and music videos. Meme videos and comedy. Literally anything you can think of already exists on YouTube in video form. And let\u2019s not forget that it also has the most entertaining comments section of the entire Internet.Arguably, then, despite all the new stuff we\u2019ve managed to accumulate in the \u201910s, YouTube remains top dog. It\u2019s not without its problems, of course. It used to have an infuriating compulsory autoplay feature for years before it was belatedly made optional, and the absence of background playing in the free version has been a bone of contention for me for years. In the U.S., YouTube also has a white nationalist problem. And then there\u2019s the fact that YouTube is owned by the same evil corporation that owns my behind, your behind, possibly even Zuckerberg\u2019s behind. Google. But on and on it saunters. That\u2019s just the dystopia we live in.The author and freelance culture writer from New Delhi wishes he\u2019d studied engineering instead.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nRed Pierrot  | Photo Credit: \nTheivaprakasham Hari  \u201cIt\u2019s a mini-encyclopedia on butterflies,\u201d declares Theivaprakasham Hari. He is talking of Butterfly Vision, his newly-launched web app that helps you identify over 300 butterflies of the Western Ghats. \u201cYou can upload any image of a butterfly and get an immediate reply on the common name and the scientific name,\u201d says Hari. As a member of The Nature and Butterfly Society (TNBS) that works towards butterfly conservation, Hari has been butterfly- spotting for over nine years. \u201cThe present identification method is based on their morphology. For example, the wing-venation, colour, shape and wing patterns. Once you spot a butterfly, you have to note down these features and compare it with images in the books on butterflies before going online. This is time consuming and often frustrating, especially for beginners,\u201d he says, adding, \u201cOne also needs to know the name of the species before referring it to an expert to confirm its rarity. Some of my friends who have done studies on butterflies spend several months on just identifying the name which means they cut down the time spent on the field. A tool like this will help them build a qualitative and quantitative data.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\nTheivaprakasham Hari \n| Photo Credit: \nSpecial Arrangement  \n\n\n\n\nThe app and the butterflyUsing the app is simple. I took a picture of a black and red butterfly outside my home and uploaded the image on the app. In an instant, I learnt that it was a Crimson RoseTo know more, visit https://butterflyvision.in/It is a free download and Hari says it is a work in progress. As the butterfly spottings increase, they will be added to the data Hari collated the butterfly images and his engineering skills to develop the web application. \u201cThe images have been uploaded after several rounds of verification to ensure that they are accurate. Species like the Common Crow, King Crow and Double-branded Crow look similar. So do the One Spot Grass Yellow, Common Grass Yellow and Three Spot Grass Yellow. For someone starting out, they simply look like yellow butterflies!The app helps them identify them correctly.\u201d Even in urban areas, one can see butterflies. \u201cSmall butterflies like Gram Blue and Pea Blue flutter around right in our neighbourhood. You just have to click a photograph and use the app to identify them.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite Four Ring \n| Photo Credit: \nTheivaprakasham Hari  \n\n\n\n\nSo far, 5000 people have downloaded the Butterfly Vision app. Hari plans to develop a similar one for dragonflies, damselflies, spiders, bugs and birds. \u201cI have added images of some of the rare butterflies like the Nilgiris Grass Yellow which we spotted recently at Tirunelveli. I plan to add a description for every butterfly along with the images shortly.\u201dFrom a conservation point of view, butterfly species identification has been a challenge, says Hari. \u201cIt is important to monitor wildlife population and diversity analysis. The app will help not just the common man but also environmentalists, scientists, conservationists and those in the academic field. It builds awareness and creates interest in butterfly documentation and conservation.\u201dNext time, when you spot a pale blue butterfly. Just log on to butterfly vision to find out if it is Deep Grass Blue, Pale Grass Blue or a Lesser Grass Blue that flew past you.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nSecurity researchers have identified that camera in Google Pixel smartphones can easily spy on you\n | Photo Credit: \nAP\n Google has announced to pay $1 million as top award to security researchers who can find a unique bug in its Pixel series of smartphones that may compromise users\u2019 data.There is an additional 50 per cent bonus if a security researcher is able to find an exploit on \u201cspecific developer preview versions of Android\u201d, resulting in a prize of $1.5 million.The Google Bug Bounty programme will reward the top prize to someone who can break into Google\u2019s Titan M \u201csecure element.\u201dSimilar to Apple\u2019s iPhone Secure Elementa, Titan M is a security chip that automatically scans hackers trying to load malware when an Android phone is turned on.For the new reward category, Google is looking for \u201cfull chain remote code execution exploit with persistence which compromises the Titan M secure element on Pixel devices.\u201d\u201cWe will reward extra for a full exploit chain (typically multiple vulnerabilities chained together) that demonstrates arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, or a lockscreen bypass,\u201d said Google.When Google first introduced its bug bounty programme for Android, the biggest bug bounty reward was $38,000. Security researchers this week identified that camera in Google Pixel smartphones can easily spy on you.According to Erez Yalon and Pedro Umbelino, security researchers at cyber security firm Checkmarx, they found that vulnerabilities impact the camera apps of smartphone vendors like Google Pixel and some Samsung devices in the Android ecosystem, presenting significant implications to hundreds-of-millions of smartphone users.After a detailed analysis of the Google Camera app, the team found that by manipulating specific actions and intents, an attacker can control the app to take photos and/or record videos through a rogue application that has no permissions to do so.Google has now matched Apple in rewarding bug hunters.Apple is planning to supply special iPhones to security researchers to help them tackle malicious hackers before they trespass or damage systems and to discover flaws and vulnerabilities better.Researchers with a security research track record of high-quality systems on any platform are eligible to apply and they could end up earning a maximum payout of $1 million.Apple launched its bug bounty programme three years ago at the Black Hat conference and is now extending its use to cover macOS, Apple Watch, Apple TV, and more.Software giant Microsoft has also announced its Azure Security Lab, intended to give experts a sandbox-like safe environment to test its Cloud security services better. The company also doubled the top Azure bug bounty reward for researchers to $40,000.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nThe feature is not the equivalent of a delete button, but hides replies behind an icon\n | Photo Credit: \nAFP\n Twitter has finally rolled out its \u2018Hide Replies\u2019 feature globally, which lets users hide replies they think are irrelevant, off-topic, or annoying and are changing the course of the discussion on the platform.The option to hide replies that may be offensive, hateful or racist in nature has rolled out globally on iOS, Android, Twitter Lite and twitter.com, the micro-blogging platform said in a statement on Thursday.\u201cTo give you more control over the conversations you start, we tested the option for you to hide replies to your Tweets. We learned that the feature is a useful new way to manage your conversations. Today, we\u2019re making this available to everyone globally,\u201d said Twitter.Here\u2019s how it works. Anyone can choose to hide replies to their Tweets. Everyone can see and engage with hidden replies by tapping the grey icon that will appear on the Tweets.This way, users will have more control over the conversations they start but people can still see the entire conversation. It is not the equivalent of a delete button, but hides replies behind an icon. If your followers still want to see the hidden replies, they can press the icon and view those.A Twitter user can also hide replies that attempt to correct misinformation or offer a fact check. The feature was first tested in Canada in July, then in the US and Japan this September.In Canada, 27 per cent of people who had their Tweets hidden said they would reconsider how they interact with others in the future. Also, they thought it was a helpful way to manage what they saw, similar to muted keywords.\u201cSome people mentioned that they didn\u2019t want to hide replies due to fear of retaliation as the icon remains visible. We\u2019ll continue to get feedback on this,\u201d said Twitter.The company said it was also working on new controls and more clarity around the rules of conversation spaces.It will soon launch a new \u2018hide replies endpoint\u2019 so developers can build additional conversation management tools.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nThe U.S. Commerce Department confirmed it had begun issuing licenses for some companies to sell goods to Huawei, expanding the company\u2019s supplier base and providing long-awaited clarity to the industry that once sold it billions of dollars worth of goods\n | Photo Credit: \nAP\n Microsoft Corp said on Thursday it had been granted a license from the U.S. government to export software to Huawei Technologies Co Ltd.\u201cOn November 20, the U.S. Department of Commerce granted Microsoft\u2019s request for a license to export mass-market software to Huawei. We appreciate the Department\u2019s action in response to our request,\u201d a Microsoft spokesman told Reuters via email.The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump said this week it would allow some suppliers to restart sales to the Chinese telecoms giant, which was placed on a trade blacklist over national security concerns six months ago.The Commerce Department confirmed it had begun issuing licenses for some companies to sell goods to Huawei, expanding the company\u2019s supplier base and providing long-awaited clarity to the industry that once sold it billions of dollars worth of goods.On Wednesday, a U.S. official said it had received roughly 300 license requests, about half of which had been processed. Roughly half of those or one quarter of the total had been approved and the rest denied.It was not immediately clear which products had been approved for sale to Huawei, which is the world\u2019s top telecommunications equipment maker and second-largest smartphone maker. A person familiar with the process said Wednesday that some licenses for sales of cellphone components and non-electronic components were approved.Microsoft declined to comment beyond its statement on which products had been approved, and the Commerce Department declined to comment.Dan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities, said the license was most likely for the company\u2019s Windows operating system.\u201cThis will be a major relief for Huawei after an arduous period with large technology players like Microsoft, Google and others restricted on the platform,\u201d Ives said.Huawei has been anxiously awaiting a licence for Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google to supply its mobile services to new models. Without access to Google services such as its Play Store for apps, Huawei phones will become harder to sell to consumers outside of China. Google declined to comment on Thursday.The granting of licenses comes as the Trump administration is working to sign a phase one trade deal with China to end a tit-for-tat trade war that has roiled markets and hit global growth.But the move immediately met with opposition. A bipartisan group of 15 senators urged the Commerce Department to suspend the issuing of licenses, saying it could threaten U.S. security.In a letter on Thursday to Trump, the senators said the administration should halt issuing licenses until it provides Congress \u201ca report outlining specific criteria for determining whether or not the approval of any license poses a national security threat.\u201dYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nTesla CEO Elon Musk introduces the Cybertruck at Tesla's design studio on Thursday, November 21, 2019, in Hawthorne, California. Musk is taking on the workhorse heavy pickup truck market with his latest electric vehicle.  | Photo Credit: AP  Tesla Inc on Thursday unveiled its first pickup truck, delivering on a promise by Chief Executive Elon Musk to build an electric version of America's favourite vehicle and one that threatens the heart of Detroit automakers' profits.At a launch event in Los Angeles, Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk said the truck, which looked liked a futuristic armoured vehicle, will have a starting price of $39,900 and a maximum range of 500 plus miles.\u201cWe need sustainable energy now. If we don't have a pickup truck we can't solve it. The top 3 selling vehicles in America are pickup trucks. To solve sustainable energy, we have to have a pickup truck,\u201d he said.Production is expected to begin in late 2021.Mr. Musk earlier tweeted the design was partly influenced by the Lotus Esprit sportscar that doubled as a submarine in the 1970s 007 film The Spy Who Loved Me.The truck marks the first foray by Tesla, whose Model 3 sedan is the world's top-selling battery electric car, into pickup trucks, a market dominated by Ford Motor Co's F-150, along with models by General Motors Co, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV .The pickup shifts Tesla more toward trucks and SUVs. The automaker has so far sold mostly Model S and Model 3 sedans, but also offers the Model X SUV and starting next year the Model Y compact SUV.A focus on the high-performance end of the market is only natural given the success of Ford's 450-horsepower F-150 Raptor truck, which launched in 2009 and whose sales have since risen annually, according to Ford spokesman Mike Levine.While Ford does not disclose Raptor sales, Levine said annual demand is well above 19,000 vehicles and the No. 2 U.S. automaker has never had to offer incentives on the model, which costs in the high $60,000 range. Ford also offers the more expensive F-150 Limited, its most powerful and luxurious pickup.Ford and GM are also gearing up to challenge Tesla more directly with new offerings like the Ford Mustang Mach E electric SUV as well as electric pickups.Electric pickups and SUVs could help Ford and GM generate the significant EV sales they will need to meet tougher emission standards and EV mandates in California and other states.The Trump administration is moving to roll back those standards, but electric trucks are a hedge if California prevails.Demand for full-size electric pickup trucks in the near term may not be huge, however.Industry tracking firm IHS Markit estimates the electric truck segment \u2014 both full and mid-sized models \u2014 will account for about 75,000 sales in 2026, compared with an expected 3 million light trucks overall. The Tesla truck is not part of that estimate.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days. Already have an account ?

      "\nThe bot is designed with novel \u201cdeductive reasoning\u201d added into an AI algorithm commonly used for playing poker\n | Photo Credit: \nGetty Images/iStockphoto\n Researchers have developed an artificial intelligence-enabled machine that can beat human players in a tricky online multiplayer game where player roles and motives are kept secret, says a study. It was presented at International Conference on Information Systems.The machine, called \u2018DeepRole\u2019, is the first gaming bot that can win online multiplayer games in which the participants\u2019 team allegiances are initially unclear, according the study from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), US.The bot is designed with novel \u201cdeductive reasoning\u201d added into an AI algorithm commonly used for playing poker. This helps it reason about partially observable actions, to determine the probability that a given player is a teammate or opponent. In doing so, it quickly learns whom to ally with and which actions to take to ensure its team\u2019s victory.\u201cIf you replace a human teammate with a bot, you can expect a higher win rate for your team. Bots are better partners,\u201d said study first author Jack Serrino from MIT.The researchers pitted DeepRole against human players in more than 4,000 rounds of the online game The Resistance: Avalon. In this game, players try to deduce their peers\u2019 secret roles as the game progresses, while simultaneously hiding their own roles. As both a teammate and an opponent, DeepRole consistently outperformed human players. \u201cHumans learn from and cooperate with others, and that enables us to achieve together things that none of us can achieve alone,\u201d said study co-author Max Kleiman\u2014Weiner.\u201cGames like Avalon better mimic the dynamic social settings humans experience in everyday life. You have to figure out who\u2019s on your team and will work with you, whether it\u2019s your first day of kindergarten or another day in your office,\u201d Kleiman-Weiners said. The bot is trained by playing against itself as both resistance and spy. When playing an online game, it uses its game tree to estimate what each player is going to do.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nIt was not immediately clear which products had been approved for sale to the world\u2019s top telecommunications equipment maker\n | Photo Credit: \nAFP\n The Trump administration on Wednesday gave Huawei its second reprieve this week, allowing some suppliers to restart sales to the Chinese telecoms giant after it was placed on a trade black list over national security concerns six months ago.The Commerce Department said it has begun issuing licenses for some companies to sell goods to Huawei, expanding the company\u2019s supplier base and providing long-awaited clarity to the industry that once sold it billions of dollars worth of goods.It was not immediately clear which products had been approved for sale to the world\u2019s top telecommunications equipment maker. But Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, also the second-largest smartphone maker, has been anxiously awaiting a license for Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google to supply its mobile services to new models. Google declined to comment.A U.S. official said of roughly 300 license requests, about half have been processed. Roughly half of those or one quarter of the total have been approved and the rest have been denied.A different person familiar with the process added that some licenses for sales of cell phone components and non-electronic components were approved.\u201cThe Department is issuing these narrow licenses to authorise limited and specific activities that do not pose a significant risk to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States,\u201d the Commerce Department said in a statement, without providing further detail.The move came after the Commerce Department renewed the so-called temporary general license for the company for a third time on Monday, extending permission for Huawei to engage in limited transactions to assist U.S. rural network operators.The goodwill gestures come as the Trump administration is working to sign a phase one trade deal with China to end a tit-for-tat trade war that has roiled markets and hit global growth.Many China hawks have voiced fears that the administration could relax sanctions on Huawei to appease Beijing and score a win on trade.Republican Senator Marco Rubio said in a statement the company \u201cposes a clear and growing threat to the economic and national security\u201d of the United States and its allies.\u201cI strongly believe it\u2019s against America\u2019s national security interest to grant licenses for U.S exports that sustain or strengthen Huawei,\u201d he said, adding that the Commerce Department should inform lawmakers of what licenses were given.But the Semiconductor Industry Association, a trade group, welcomed the Commerce Department\u2019s announcement, saying sales of the non-sensitive items help ensure the competitiveness of U.S. chipmakers, \u201cwhich is essential to national security.\u201d\u201cWe hope license approvals continue to proceed in an appropriate and timely manner,\u201d the group added.The United States has pending cases against Huawei for allegedly stealing American intellectual property and violating Iran sanctions. The administration has also lobbied U.S. allies to keep Huawei out of next-generation 5G telecommunications infrastructure. Huawei denied the allegations.The Trump administration put Huawei on a trade blacklist, citing national security concerns in May after trade talks broke down. Companies on the list are not allowed to receive shipments of U.S. goods without a special license from the Commerce Department.But in June, U.S. President Donald Trump said some sales would be allowed to the company, and U.S. officials urged firms to apply for licenses, noting that they would be granted in cases where the items were readily available and did not compromise national security.But until Wednesday, there had been no responses on the license requests.Despite the good news, plenty of headwinds remain for Huawei, which is still awaiting rules from the Commerce Department that are expected to bar them from the U.S. telecoms network.\u201cThe White House isn\u2019t ready to pull the plug on Huawei because that would do almost as much harm to U.S. companies,\u201d said James Lewis, a technology expert with the Washington-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cBut they\u2019re keeping it in reserve,\u201d he added.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/google-bars-elections-ads-from-using-political-leanings-voter-data/article30034474.ece",
      "Alphabet Inc's Google will stop giving advertisers the ability to target election ads using data such as public voter records and general political affiliations, the company said in a blog post on November 20.The move coincides with pressure on social media platforms over their handling of political advertising ahead of the U.S. presidential election in 2020.Google said it would limit audience targeting for election ads to age, gender and general location at a postal code level. Political advertisers also can still contextually target, such as serving ads to people reading about a certain topic.Previously, verified political advertisers could also target ads using data gleaned from users' behavior, such as search actions, that categorized them as left-leaning, right-leaning or independent. They could also upload data such as voter file lists to target ads to a lookalike audience which exhibited similar behaviors to those in the data.Google will enforce the new approach in the United Kingdom within a week, ahead of the Dec. 12 general election. Google said it would enforce it in the European Union by the end of the year and in the rest of the world starting on Jan. 6, 2020.\u201cGiven recent concerns and debates about political advertising, and the importance of shared trust in the democratic process, we want to improve voters' confidence in the political ads they may see on our ad platforms,\u201d Scott Spencer, vice president of product management for Google Ads, said in the blog post.The changes are expected to prompt political campaigns to shift some ads to television and Google's smaller rivals. Tim Cameron, chief executive of FlexPoint Media, which buys ads for Republican campaigns, said he will stop licensing Google's ad-buying tool in January because of the new restrictions.The voter file feature had enabled FlexPoint to target people who did not regularly cast a ballot and encourage them to turn out. The loss of such targeting could result in \u201ca slow decline of civic participation\u201d and hurt the ability of \u201dinsurgent, underfunded candidates\u201d to gain support, Cameron said.Google also added examples to its misrepresentation policy to show that it would not allow false claims about election results or the eligibility of political candidates based on age or birthplace.Last month, Google refused to remove an ad run by President Donald Trump's re-election campaign on its YouTube video-streaming service that Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden's campaign said contained false claims, because it did not violate the policy.A Google spokeswoman told Reuters on November 20 that the video would still be allowed under the latest policy. Google also clarified that its policies for political and nonpolitical ads prohibit doctored and manipulated media.On Dec. 3, the company will expand its ad transparency efforts to ads related to state-level elections, including them in an online database created to catalog political advertising.Twitter Inc has banned political ads, while Facebook Inc is reviewing its policies after criticism from lawmakers and regulators over its decision to not fact-check ads run by politicians.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nRohim Momin in his Josh Talks video  Rohim Momin was a school dropout who went on to represent India in the world forum with his masonry at the 2017 edition of WorldSkills \u2014 a global championship of vocational skills, that is held every two years in different parts of the world. He shares the motivational story of his journey from migrant worker to winning a Medallion of Excellence for bricklaying, on Indian digital media platform, Josh Talks. This video is the first of many, which will be part of their recent collaboration with the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC).The platform, which has earlier partnered with entities like Facebook, UN Women and the Indian Army, will leverage the skill and vocational training abilities of both the forums. Supriya Paul, co-founder of Josh Talks, adds, \u201cWe want to further stress on the importance of skills so that people can create livelihoods for themselves.\u201d Like Momin, other beneficiaries of NSDC\u2019s skill development programmes will record motivational videos for the online platform. The series will also feature past winners of the biennial event that is centred around vocational efficiency. \u201cShowcasing these stories are important as a perception building activity for our viewers,\u201d stresses Paul. As of now, Josh Talks engages a non-English speaking audience from tier 2 and 3 cities, through videos and other online content in regional languages. While the NSDC hopes to tap into this repository to further their programmes, Josh Talks hopes to gain access to a larger audience for their recently-launched skill training courses. The organisations will co-create vocational courses which will be available on NSDC\u2019s website. These include necessary soft skills like personality development, confidence building, English language, job interview preparation and resume building courses. In the long term, Josh Talks aims at hosting real-time, offline round table conferences that will showcase these achievers, while engaging people from other digital platforms, civil society organisations, content creators and policy makers from relevant government ministries. \u201cThe goal is to get more e-learning platforms involved to create content that\u2019s more relevant to our kind of target audience,\u201d concludes Paul.

We have made this decision based on our belief that political message reach should be earned, not bought,\u201d the micro-blogging platform said on Friday.On October 31, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey had tweeted: \u201cWhile internet advertising is incredibly powerful and very effective for commercial advertisers, that power brings significant risks to politics.\u201dYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

Several users reported losing access to their accounts\n | Photo Credit: \nAP\n As Disney garnered over 10 million subscribers for its online streaming service Disney+ on its first day of operation, reports have surfaced on Monday that hackers have already hijacked thousands of accounts and put them up for sale on the Dark Web.ZDNet discovered several listings for Disney+ accounts on different underground hacking forums, selling for somewhere between $3 and $5.The Disney+ launch was marred by technical issues and users reported being unable to stream their favourite movies and shows. Several users reported losing access to their accounts.\u201cMany users reported that hackers were accessing their accounts, logging them out of all devices, and then changing the account\u2019s email and password, effectively taking over the account and locking the previous owner out,\u201d said the report on Sunday.Disney was yet to comment.In some cases, hackers gained access to accounts by using email and password combos leaked at other sites, while in other cases \u201cthe Disney+ credentials might have been obtained from users infected with key-logging or info-stealing malware\u201d.Researchers asked Disney+ to help users by rolling out support for multi-factor authentication and prevent more attacks.On the very first day of release on November 12, Disney+ users collectively spent 1.3 million hours streaming and watching the content available to them on the platform for the first day of release.As per reports, analysts projected that Disney+ would have anywhere between 10-18 million subscribers in its first year. Disney has signed up more than half of those projected numbers in 24 hours.The service was launched in the US for $6.99 per month or $69 per year.The company has announced that the service will be launched in major European markets, including the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and \u201ca number of other countries in the region\u201d on March 31 next year.Earlier, Disney had said that it expected to spend about $1 billion in 2020 on original content for the platform and $2 billion by 2024.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

This decision does not change the fact that Huawei continues to be treated unfairly either.\u201dThe company argues the decision to \u201cadd Huawei to the Entity List has caused more harm to the US than to Huawei. This has done significant economic harm to the American companies with which Huawei does business.\u201dIn May, President Donald Trump also signed an executive order declaring a national emergency and barring U.S. companies from using telecommunications equipment made by companies posing a national security risk. The Commerce Department was directed to draw up an enforcement plan by mid-October but has yet to publish one.The Commerce Department is also considering whether to grant individual licenses for U.S. firms to sell components to Huawei after receiving more than 200 requests. No action on those was taken on Monday.The development comes amid discussions between the United States and China aimed at coming to an initial agreement to resolve a trade war that has lasted for over a year.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) returns to launching its operational satellites this month after a hiatus of six months.Cartosat-3, an advanced earth imaging and mapping satellite, will be flown on November 25 on the PSLV-C47 vehicle, subject to weather conditions, the space agency announced on Monday.The 1,560 kg satellite will have 13 small U.S. customer satellites riding as secondary passengers. They will be placed in a polar orbit.Although ISRO sent up Chandrayaan 2, the lunar orbiter probe, in July, its previous functional satellite was RISAT-2B, launched in May.Cartosat-3, with an ISRO-best resolution of 25 cm, will be the first of a series of high resolution, third generation satellites planned for observing the Earth. The satellite will be able to pick up objects of that size (25 cm) from its orbital perch about 509 km away. This will make Cartosat-3 among the few sharpest civil earth imagers worldwide.Previously, the Cartosat-2 second generation series offered the best resolution of 65 cm from ISRO. The agency entered the sub-metre (80 cm) resolution club in 2007 with Cartosat-2, the best civil imagery resolution of that time.Much of such high resolution imageries are used exclusively by the Armed Forces.\u201cPSLV-C47 will launch Cartosat-3 and 13 commercial nanosatellites into a sun synchronous orbit from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota. The launch is tentatively scheduled at 9.28 a.m. IST on November 25, subject to weather conditions,\u201d ISRO said.Recently, Planet Labs, a U.S.-based earth imaging company, said 12 of its SuperDove/Flock 4p constellation of cubesats would be flown with Cartosat-3.For this mission, the PSLV is being flown in its XL, or extended version, with six added or strapped on booster rockets.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "My souring love story with Apple",

      "\nAll Apple  My love story began as a nodding acquaintance in the basement of a newspaper office. I would step into the small partitioned room with three men furiously tapping away on a computer with an orange keyboard and see flickering green letters come alive on the screen. A few feet away was another computer. All white, with a slot for a floppy drive, and a small rainbow-coloured half-eaten-apple as the logo. The keyboard brought alive some of the most beautiful letters on the screen. Zapf Dingbats, Garamond, Helvetica and other typefaces with their curvy elegance would get printed out in real time. I was hooked. The computer was used for printing out headlines in the newspaper office in Nagpur.Years later, when a friend visited the US of A, I asked her to get me an iPod Shuffle. I got a bright blue device that fit perfectly into the small pocket of my jeans. Loaded with my favourite songs that could be shuffled randomly with a white flywheel, it was a delight to listen to Dire Straits or Roxette (yes, I am old) while going for a jog. It was a big upgrade from a chunky MP3 player called Creative Zen that required me to use great ingenuity to switch songs. Also, the Shuffle was 10 times smaller. \u2018Life is Random\u2019 never sounded more fun.It turned into a roaring affair when I stood in the queue on the midnight of March 2, 2010 and handed out a wad of cash to get hold of the iPhone 3GS. It was curvy, it was pillowy and it responded to touch. I filed the story of the purchase for my newspaper standing outside the shop in Begumpet in Hyderabad.Apple launched MacBook Air with an Intel chip and I had it within months of its launch. Writing, reading, blogging, browsing and clicking selfies using the built-in camera was a joy. The best part, I didn\u2019t have to worry about viruses like the other folks who used four square boxes. I could even watch DVDs on the small white box of love. While Ctrl+Alt+Del was the go-to command on the office computer, on my MacBook Air, I never had to resort to such drastic actions. Then Apple launched an 11-inch MacBook Air and I had it within months. Slimmer without the outdated CD slot, it was a breeze. I was not just using the Apple products, I was an evangelist. Friends too fell in love hearing my love story.Then disaster struck. I bought an iPhone XS. Apple insisted that I use Siri. I didn\u2019t want to. Who wants someone else to be listening all the time? Even now it says, \u2018Finish setting up your iPhone\u2019. I don\u2019t want to. In May 2019, Apple launched a MacBook Pro featuring a 2.4 GHz Quad-Core processor. I switched it on and then tried to switch the language. Nothing. The keyboard was dead. I never had to hit chatrooms to find solutions for issues with my MacBook. But once I began searching for the problem, I realised I was in trouble. Big trouble. Solutions like resetting the SMC (system management controller) and resetting Parameter RAM didn\u2019t work. The keyboard stayed dead. Apparently, the butterfly keyboard had problems since its conception and I realised that many fanboys of Apple were furious. Some of them even signed a petition demanding a recall of the failed keyboard. I was ready to formalise my divorce as I walked into the Apple service centre. After testing my patience for a week, I got my MacBook Pro and it is working fine.Now, I am told the newly-launched 16-inch MacBook Pro has the older keyboard design and is more springy.Maybe I should\u2026 Should I?You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "Godfather of gaming: Hideo Kojima's incredible legacy and his latest 'Death Stranding'",
      "Updated: November 19, 2019 15:38 IST\rPublished: November 18, 2019 16:00 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/hideo-kojima-and-his-evolution-and-his-relationship-with-technology/article30006560.ece",
      "\nHideo Kojima  As we have been pulling apart the massive onion that is Death Stranding, Hideo Kojima has been having quite the week. His game has opened to critical acclaim, and just last week, on November 10, he was awarded two Guinness World Records for the \u2018most followed video game director on Twitter (36,26,300 across two accounts) and Instagram (9,71,000)\u2019 underpinning his impact on gaming and pop culture. Kojima, over the years, has garnered legions of international fans.\n\n\n\n\n\nHideo Kojima with his Guinness World Records\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBorn in the Setagaya area of Tokyo, Japan, Kojima nurtured a love for cinema and literature through his teenage years, but faced a lot of pressure to pursue a more lucrative career. He wound up studying economics at university, during which time, he discovered video games on a Nintendo Famicom. This fuelled a switch to video game design in the fourth year of his degree.  \n\n\n\n\nHis first big break as a designer came in 1986 with Japanese entertainment conglomerate Konami\u2019s MSX home computer division. MSX is a standardised home architecture system favoured by early game developers, including Konami. This would later frustrate him due to the restrictions of technology then. Eventually, his bold visions would motivate him to innovate and create the technology that would support them.Kojima\u2019s d\u00e9but title Penguin Adventure (1986) was one of the first instances of multiple endings in a game. It also opened a door for him to take on the reins of the Metal Gear franchise \u2014 which not only introduced Solid Snake to us, but was also one of the first true stealth games. His other success then came in the form of the Blade Runner-esque game called Snatcher (1988), where he first experimented with camera tilts and mature content. Kojima kept evolving this cult favourite with recorded dialogue as it transitioned to CD-ROM formats in 1992. Metal Gear Solid was unveiled at the 1996 Tokyo Game Show in Chiba, and \u2014 much like Death Stranding now \u2014 no one had experienced anything quite like it, for its complex storyline and movie quality cut-scenes.\n\n\n\n\n\nA snapshot from Metal Gear Solid \n\n\n\n\n\nNever wanting to be in one vertical, he also worked on other projects, including space-mecha-combat game Zone of the Enders, courting mild successes in rebooting vampire-based game Castlevania with Lords of Shadow. Yet, his fate was always entwined with that of the Metal Gear universe, until a radically different project.Released as a free demo in 2014, P.T. (or Playable Teaser) is a first-person psychological horror video game set in a looping hallway of jump scares. While the game did not have cut-scenes, the entire hallway sequence was structured like a playable hand-held horror movie. \u201cKojima is a true auteur of storytelling in gaming, due to his expressive ideology of human connection, his detail of game-play mechanics and underlying truth that as a species we hold responsibility to the world. Kojima is an important voice in a world of storytelling, far beyond cinema,\u201d says Amit Tida, documentary producer and shamanic gamer.\n\n\n\n\n\nA snapshot from P.T. (Playable Teaser) \n\n\n\n\n\nTo many gamers\u2019 delight, it was co-directed by Kojima and Guillermo del Toro, and this experience would eventually lead to a reboot of the well-known Silent Hill franchise. Sadly, things soured between Kojima and Konami, and as a result, P.T. was pulled out. Till today, those surviving P.T. demos have remained undeleted on PlayStations and players are actively experiencing new phenomenon. Prior to leaving Konami to re-form his studio, Kojima made Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. Kojima Productions is entirely independent, and they with Sony unleash his full potential with Death Stranding, of which the trailer was unveiled at the E3 conference in 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\nA snapshot from Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain \n\n\n\n\n\nHe explained his philosophy in a recent interview with Game Informer, \u201cPreviously, in design, you had to create the rule because you couldn\u2019t do the realism. In our everyday lives, there are so many mechanisms we have to work through, and we have to take the balance of what we do, how we maintain ourselves, and how we live. I wanted to free the game design concept that we had to live by because we didn\u2019t have the technology to do so in the past.\u201d Kojima is known to flagrate global anticipation prior to his creations\u2019 releases. For example, the feverish viral confusion that followed the trailer of the recent Death Stranding. Now, gamers are working hard at piecing together that one big puzzle he created. Meanwhile, Kojima has already got future plans, to get back to what got him started down this path in the first place: making films.But what about the futurist in Kojima? He is a proponent of technology, openly adapting the tech to be a conduit for his stories. If the stories in his head require Virtual Reality, he will do so. For Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, he created the Fox game engine from the ground up. With up-to-date performance capture tech, Kojima also pushes actors to the next level in the game, a trait vocally commended by Norman Reedus (who portrays Death Stranding\u2019s protagonist).\n\n\n\n\n\nNorman Reedus and Hideo Kojima, who worked on Death Stranding together\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 56-year-old is one of the first game directors to explore cinema-style cut-scenes at an early stage to support his zest for film-making. This prompted Mad Max: Fury Road director George Miller to praise his \u201ccreative courage\u201d, a trait he sees in all great film-makers. Plus, Kojima has star power on quick-dial, as seen by the all-star cast in Death Stranding, and the full support of Sony. The stage is set for the next phase of Hideo Kojima\u2019s journey and everyone has front row seats.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

Z Holdings Corp., which owns SoftBank Corp. that operates Yahoo Japan, and Naver Corp. of South Korea, which owns a majority stake in Line said on Monday they were aiming for a final agreement by next month. The combination in a joint venture through a tender offer will form an online giant with retail services, advertising and other mobile services such as messaging. Their combined sales would be the largest among Japanese online business operators, surpassing Rakuten Inc., according to Kyodo news service. The companies said combining forces will allow them to stay competitive in a drastically changing market, including expansions into robotics and other new areas. The integration will be carried out equally, according to the companies, but the price is expected to be decided in December. A discussion had been ongoing between Naver and Z Holdings since June, they said. After a deal is completed, Line will get del-isted.

      "Google enters battle for cloud gaming market ",

      "\nThe Google logo is displayed outside the company offices in New York, U.S. File\n | Photo Credit: \nREUTERS\n  Ever-expanding Google becomes a gaming company Tuesday with the launch of its Stadia cloud service that lets people play console-quality video games on a web browser or smartphone. The Internet giant hopes to break into the global video game industry expected to top $150 billion this year, with cloud technology that could broaden audiences attracted by rich new features as well as ease of access with no more need for consoles.But analysts say Stadia\u2019s outlook is uncertain as its faces rivals such as PlayStation Now in an emerging and highly-competitive market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Stadia plays into a trend in which content \u2014 ranging from blockbuster films to work projects \u2014 lives in the cloud and is accessible from any device.\u201cAll of these new services are merely pointing out that we don\u2019t need sophisticated hardware in the home to access entertainment,\u201d said Wedbush Securities equity research managing director Michael Pachter. Google last month sold out of \u201cFounder\u2019s Edition\u201d kits, which are priced at $129.Each kit contains a Stadia controller and a pendant-shaped Chromecast Ultra wireless connection device that plugs into television sets.Stadia games are playable using Google Chrome web browser software on computers. It also works with Google-made Pixel smartphones from the second-generation onward, and on televisions.Stadia Pro subscriptions, priced at $10 a month in the U.S., will be available in 14 countries in North America and Europe. But analysts say Stadia could wind up as another \u201cbet\u201d that Google walks away from if it fails to live up to expectations.\u201cStadia will live or die by its content,\u201d said Ovum senior analyst George Jijiashvili.\u201cThe announced 12 launch titles are underwhelming.\u201d Subscribers will be able to buy games that will be hosted at Google data-centers, but some free games will be available to subscribers, starting with \u201cDestiny 2: The Collection.\u201d Stadia on smartphones will work with WiFi connections rather than rely on mobile telecom services. Being able to play without lags or interruptions is paramount to gamers, and flawed Internet connections could cause frustration. Internet speed will also determine how rich in-game graphics can be. Some promised features such as integration with YouTube will not be in place at launch.\u201cStadia appears to be rushed out the door before fully ready and, worryingly, Google is risking falling short on its promises,\u201d Mr. Jijiashvili said. .\u201cThese shortcomings however would be easily overlooked if Google can deliver a very reliable and high-quality game streaming service.\u201d Google appears committed to doing just that, according to Ubisoft senior vice president of partnerships Chris Early. The French video game giant has been working with Google and its games are among titles coming to the service.\u201cFrom what I have seen, their plans are too deep; they are too good, and they are too invested,\u201d Early said. \u201cThey are not calling it quits any time soon.\u201d He expects a long launch period during which Google will beef up Stadia.\u201cIf there is a one-day problem at launch, it isn\u2019t the end of the world; it isn\u2019t even close,\u201d he said, stressing the potential for Stadia to let people play without investing in consoles.But Mr. Pachter questioned whether subscriptions were the right approach. .\u201cThe right model is pay as you go or pay for the game and play unlimited without a subscription,\u201d Mr. Pachter said.\u201cAmazon will try one of those and will win the streaming wars.\u201d Amazon has game studios but no online game service.U.S. technology veteran Microsoft has been testing a Project xCloud online game platform.\u201cNext year, we\u2019ll bring Project xCloud to Windows PCs, and are collaborating with a broad set of partners to make game streaming available on other devices as well,\u201d Microsoft corporate vice president Kareem Choudhry said in an online post. Sony Interactive Entertainment last month slashed the price of its PlayStation Now cloud video game service by about half in the U.S. to $10 monthly. Japan-based Sony also boosted the library of games that PlayStation Now users can access through its consoles or on personal computers powered by Windows software. Sony and Microsoft are also poised to release new-generation video game consoles next year.\u201cWhile we expect dedicated consoles to eventually lose relevance in the face of cloud gaming services, there\u2019s no guarantee that it will be Google\u2019s service \u2014 rather than Sony and Microsoft\u2019s \u2014 that catalyzes this trend,\u201d said Ovum senior analyst Matthew Bailey.

      "\nBe it a fitness tracker, smartwatch, smart speaker or smart home assistant, the way Bluetooth devices communicate with the mobile apps leaves room for hackers to steal sensitive personal information, new research has found.\n | Photo Credit: \nREUTERS\n Be it a fitness tracker, smartwatch, smart speaker or smart home assistant, the way Bluetooth devices communicate with the mobile apps leaves room for hackers to steal sensitive personal information, new research has found.An inherent design flaw makes mobile apps that work with Bluetooth Low Energy devices vulnerable to hacking, said the study described at the Association for Computing Machinery\u2019s Conference on Computer and Communications Security held in London from November 11-15.\u201cThere is a fundamental flaw that leaves these devices vulnerable \u2014 first when they are initially paired to a mobile app, and then again when they are operating,\u201d said Zhiqiang Lin, Associate Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at The Ohio State University in the US. \u201cWhile the magnitude of that vulnerability varies, we found it to be a consistent problem among Bluetooth low energy devices when communicating with mobile apps,\u201d Lin added. Consider a wearable health and fitness tracker, smart thermostat, smart speaker or smart home assistant. Each first communicates with the apps on your mobile device by broadcasting something called a UUID \u2014 a universally unique identifier. That identifier allows the corresponding apps on your phone to recognise the Bluetooth device, creating a connection that allows your phone and device to talk to one another.But that identifier itself is also embedded into the mobile app code. Otherwise, mobile apps would not be able to recognise the device. However, such UUIDs in the mobile apps make the devices vulnerable to a fingerprinting attack, the research team found.\u201cAt a minimum, a hacker could determine whether you have a particular Bluetooth device, such as a smart speaker, at your home, by identifying whether or not your smart device is broadcasting the particular UUIDs identified from the corresponding mobile apps,\u201d Lin said.\u201cBut in some cases in which no encryption is involved or encryption is used improperly between mobile apps and devices, the attacker would be able to \u2018listen in\u2019 on your conversation and collect that data.\u201d Still, that doesn\u2019t mean you should throw your smartwatch away.\u201cWe think the problem should be relatively easy to fix, and we\u2019ve made recommendations to app developers and to Bluetooth industry groups,\u201d he said.If app developers tightened defences in that initial authentication, the problem could be resolved, Lin said.The team reported their findings to developers of vulnerable apps and to the Bluetooth Special Interest Group, and created an automated tool to evaluate all of the Bluetooth Low Energy apps in the Google Play Store \u2014 18,166 at the time of their research. In addition to building the databases directly from mobile apps of the Bluetooth devices in the market, the team\u2019s evaluation also identified 1,434 vulnerable apps that allow unauthorised access. Their analysis did not include apps in the Apple Store.\u201cIt was alarming,\u201d he said. \u201cThe potential for privacy invasion is high.\u201dYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "As an entertainment provider, you have not really cemented yourself in the 21st Century if you have not got yourself an OTT platform. Currently in India alone, there are over 30 platforms racing to break new ground in technology and innovation. We have seen Lionsgate Play, Tata Sky Binge, Voot, Zee5 make forays into the market but at the moment there remains a core group of streaming services to which we subscribe instinctively. Set-top boxes (such as those of Tata Sky, Airtel and Jio) have faced scrutiny and rejection from more millennials for the lack of prompt customer service and, of course, the fact that inter-device mobility is not as seamless as it is with a streaming service. So here, we break down each of the headline-making OTT platforms, along with technologies they may use as well as how to access them: \n\n\n\n\n\nSpecials / Originals: Fleabag, Made In Heaven, Tom Clancy\u2019s Jack RyanAdditional licensed content from NBC (Blindspot, The Office US) from ITV (Downton Abbey) and CBS (Blue Bloods, 2 Broke Girls) Rates and access: USP: With the Prime subscription, a user gets access to priority delivery of purchases made on Amazon and access to Prime Music streaming.

Hotstar is owned by Star India, which belongs to The Walt Disney Company. Along with the entire catalog of Disney+ content, many titles could be localised for the Indian market by being dubbed in various regional languages. Rates and other specifics for the Indian market are yet to be revealed.\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginals/Specials:Hasan Minhaj: Patriot Act, Sacred Games, Bojack HorsemanAdditional licensed content from NBC (Friends, The Office US, Blacklist), from ABC (How To Get Away With Murder, Grey\u2019s Anatomy, Designated Survivor)Rates and access: USP: Netflix uses adaptive streaming which uses Machine Learning to recognise network conditions and adjust the video quality up or down based on that. This is to minimise buffering. Dubbing, Closed Captioning, Audio Description available across most content. \n\n\n\n\n\nOriginals/Specials:The Morning Show, The Banker (to be released), SeeNo additional licensing announcedRates and access: Back-end: Apple has remained surprisingly quiet about the technology, but users around the world have been complaining of audio-visual lags, constant buffering and resolution inconsistency.

      "\nPicture for representative purposes only.\n | Photo Credit: Getty Images/iStockphoto As many as 265 fake local news websites in more that 65 countries, including the US, Canada, Brussels and Geneva, are managed by Indian influence networks with the aim of influencing international institutions along with elected representatives and swaying the public perception of Pakistan, a study by NGO EU DisinfoLab has found.Most of these websites, the study found, were named after an extinct local newspaper or spoof real media outlets and republish content from several news agencies such as KCNA, Voice of America and Interfax. Some of these are themirrorofaustralia.com, thetimesofceylon.com, thehoovergazette.com, theseattlestar.com, miamivalleychannel.com, timesofgeneva.com and the dublingazette.com.Additionally, these sites provided coverage of the same Indian-related demonstrations and events and republications of anti-Pakistan content from the Indian influence network.Pointing out that most these websites have a Twitter account as well, EU DisinfoLab found that these fake media outlets were formed to \u201cinfluence international institutions and elected representatives with coverage of specific events and demonstrations; provide NGOs with useful press material to reinforce their credibility and thus be impactful as well as influence public perceptions on Pakistan by multiplying iterations of the same content available on search engines.\u201dFurther, it said that with several layers of media outlets that quote and republish one another, it was harder for the reader to trace the manipulation, and in turn (sometimes) offered a \u201cmirage\u201d of international support.The EU DisinfoLab said that in October, European External Action Service\u2019s East StratCom -- the EU Disinformation Task Force, had found that \u2018eptoday.com\u2019 \u2013 website of a self-proclaimed magazine for the European Parliament in Brussels, had been re-publishing a large amount of news directly from Russia Today and Voice of America. \u201cAmong this syndicated content, we unexpectedly found a large number of articles and op-eds related to minorities in Pakistan as well as other India-related matters.\u201dIt was then discovered that EP Today was managed by Indian stakeholders with ties to a large network of think tanks, NGOs, and companies from the Srivastava Group. \u201cWe also found that the IP address of the Srivastava Group is also home to the obscure online media \u2018New Delhi Times\u2019 and the International Institute for Non-Aligned Studies (IINS), which are all based at the same address in New Delhi, India.\u201dA few weeks later, 27 Members of the European Parliament were invited by IINS to visit Kashmir and to meet with Prime Minister Modi.On further investigation, the EU DisinfoLab found that timesofgeneva.com \u2013 an online \u201cnewspaper\u201d that is \u201capproaching 35 years in business\u201d, has the same content as EP Today and produces videos covering events and demonstrations criticising Pakistan\u2019s role in the Kashmir conflict.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

The world\u2019s biggest social network also disclosed for the first time how many posts it removed from popular photo-sharing app Instagram, which has been identified as a growing area of concern about fake news by disinformation researchers.Proactive detection of violating content was lower across all categories on Instagram than on Facebook\u2019s flagship app, where the company initially implemented many of its detection tools, the company said in its fourth content moderation report.For example, the company said it proactively detected content affiliated with terrorist organisations 98.5% of the time on Facebook and 92.2% of the time on Instagram. \n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook launches new company logo \n\n\n\n\nFacebook launches new company logo It removed more than 11.6 million pieces of content depicting child nudity and sexual exploitation of children on Facebook and 754,000 pieces on Instagram during the third quarter.Law enforcement is concerned that Facebook\u2019s plans to provide greater privacy to users by encrypting the company\u2019s messaging services will hamper efforts to fight child abuse.In October, FBI Director Christopher Wray said the changes would turn the platform into a \u201cdream come true for predators and child pornographers\u201d.Facebook also added data on actions it took around content involving self-harm for the first time in the report.

      "An inconspicuous apartment, three storeys above and off busy Sardar Patel Road in Adyar, is where this scene unfolds. Nothing major, we are here to eat food. Except, there is no chef or cook involved; our dinner will be prepared by automated technology.\u201cWe have pre-programmed nearly 600 dishes into it,\u201d says Saravanan Sundaramoorthy, CEO and founder, Robochef. The \u201cit\u201d he is referring to is not a humanoid, walking and talking \u2014 \u201cI have seen it in the film Enthiran\u201d \u2014 type robot. Robochef is a massive stainless steel structure, which looks like unwieldy kitchen equipment with very little visually pleasing detail.Inside Robochef, moving belts that carry utensils, and containers that deliver spices and vegetables into the main cooking vessel, are operated by sensors tuned using computer codes.We watch one of the machines cook kesari. After a helper loads the machine with rava, sugar and other ingredients necessary for the dish, a tap of a button on a computer initiates the frying process. Soon, the steel utensil carrying ghee unloads it into the main cooking vessel, and the in-built automated twin-headed spatula starts stirring the mixture until it attains the required thickness. In a few minutes, dessert is ready. \u201cRobochef stands out because there is no need for human intervention at any stage after raw ingredients are loaded into the machine. You don\u2019t even need to chop the vegetables or worry about cleaning it,\u201d claims Saravanan.His team simultaneously cooks seeraga samba chicken biryani and chicken curry. He offers us a plate. It tastes exactly the same as the order from your neighbourhood biryani stall.However, nuances associated to idiosyncratic cooking styles attributed to human intelligence can be found wanting in automated cooking. Robochef is currently a ghost kitchen (a kitchen set up for preparing delivery-only meals). \u201cWe have tied up with caterers who supply in bulk to events and hotels. Our product has helped them improve their gains, and takes out the dependency on a cook,\u201d says Saravanan.There are two variants of the machine that Saravanan has built \u2014 the commercial variant that he sells for \u20b945 lakh, meant for commercial ghost kitchens, and the domestic variant that he has priced at \u20b96 lakh, which, he adds, has already found a few customers. He says the warranty for the first year is included in the price. The numbers he puts forward are mind-boggling. He claims that he can supply an item, for instance, seeraga samba chicken biriyani (which retails upwards of \u20b9130) for as little as \u20b960. \u201cI would still stand to make a handsome profit margin on these numbers,\u201d he adds. Which is why he has an ambitious plan of entering the restaurant business himself, with this technology. \u201cThere is no point in licensing or selling this concept to an established restaurant chain,\u201d he says. \u201cInstead, I intend to start a franchisee business under Robochef\u2019s brand identity.\u201d Watch this space. Robochef now operates centralised kitchens in Adyar, Alandur and Velachery.

      "Explore limitless gaming with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and Kojima\u2019s Death Stranding",

      "\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare\n | Photo Credit: \nSpecial Arrangement\n 2019 presented some pretty impressive games which broke ground, tech-wise. While Call Of Duty rarely disappoints in the realm of first-person shooter, Death Stranding has been garnering more curiosity for its mysterious plotline and star-studded cast and crew. Babies in pods, mysterious handprints and a whole cast of characters with strange names like Die-Hardman. Death Stranding has weaved an intricate cobweb of curiosity around it with legendary game designer Hideo Kojima directing that chaos. Now that it\u2019s out, we finally know what it is about, sort of.You assume the role of a sci-fi delivery guy named Sam Porter Bridges, played by Normal Reedus, who is tasked with delivering parcels across a post-apocalyptic America in the hope of reconnecting everything. It is very hard to categorise Death Stranding, as it skews several game genres and creates something completely different. One thing is clear though \u2014 the story is excellent, in acting, pacing and it has Kojima\u2019s hallmark style throughout. Which means that it is long, drawn-out and takes it time in telling.Death StrandingDeveloper: Kojima ProductionsPublisher: SonyPrice: \u20b93999 for the PlayStation 4Much like the Jenga tower of parcels Sam has to lug around, the game strives hard to balance all its ideas into something coherent while trying to be different. Most of the game is a brutal slog, as you have to manually sort of balance your load on harsh terrain. For any mistake will send you on an even worse slog of recovering your lost loot. Just as you are about to tear your hair out a few hours into the game, things get good, as you\u2019re connected to the Chiral Network. Which allows you to traverse the realm with ease, using ladders and the like to help other players as well as let them help you.Encounters with beached things (BT), the invisible monsters, are tense and the best parts of the game, which explains the Bridge Baby or BB. A bridge to the realm of the dead that notifies you of these entities. There is an Aliens-like motion detector quality of these sequences as you sneak past the BTs until you get the means to kill them later. There are human enemies too, whom you can get creative in dealing with, like with grenades made out of your body waste.\n\n\n\n\n\nDeath Stranding\n\n| Photo Credit: \nSpecial Arrangment\n \n\n\n\n\nDespite the slog, the game is engaging, making each delivery feel like it counts, even though they\u2019re fetch quests. Except to get to the good parts you will need to trudge through the tedious inventory management and uneven traversal. Recommended if you are feeling brave and want to try something different or if you are a die-hard Kojima fan.Mid-campaign, a young sergeant asks a pointed question \u2018where do we draw the line?\u2019. We always look at lives of soldiers and covert operatives with James Bond-like views, when these are the people who have to make the hard choices, often knee-deep in the dirt. That line gets thinner as Modern Warfare touches on the vicious circle of a fight against terrorism where the line blurs between good guy and bad guy. One man\u2019s terrorist is another man\u2019s freedom fighter.Call of Duty: Modern WarfareDeveloper: Infinity WardPublisher: ActivisionPrice: \u20b94699 PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PCYou play Modern Warfare from two different perspectives. Alex, a covert CIA operative\u2019s search for a stolen shipment of deadly gas canisters, leads him to working with Urzikstan\u2019s rebel force led by Farah Karim, to free the country from a rogue Russian general who believes he is eradicating terrorists. Meanwhile, Sergeant Kyle with Captain Price are sent Alex and Farah\u2019s way after a suicide bombing in London.The campaign is edge-of-the-seat, with every second carrying a payload of the palpable tension of a summer blockbuster. Expertly weaving you from claustrophobic close quarters, where you have to choose your targets wisely, to massive war sequences around the globe. Letting you play as a seasoned solider in a clandestine war, as well as a kid in the midst of a chemical attack, the game takes some bold steps in its narrative, with a handful of memorable moments that will hit you hard.\n\n\n\n\n\nCall of Duty has always been tight with the combat, distilled over years of perfecting its formula. The gun play is tight as expected and it keeps things fresh by letting you try out different weapons. You also get a chance to control drones, call in air strikes and even control explosive-laden RC Planes.The game engine looks incredible, especially in rendering the battlefield devastation realism. From twitching bodies of dying people to animals struggling with their breath, the game portrays the horrors of war. The game is plagued by bad cut-scene frame rates and crashes, even though the game-play is smooth. Which is a shame because the cut-scenes are beautifully rendered.It is very rare when a reboot is a lot better than the original and Modern Warfare paints a compelling story with gun smoke and blood. Highly recommended, with a campaign that you will remember for years to come.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "While returning from a trip, early one morning, with his wife and five-year-old son in Balangir last April, Kuldeep Pattnaik\u2019s car fractionally missed a speeding lorry. \u201cAnything could have happened that day,\u201d he says. One of the first things that came to his mind, then, was his son\u2019s education. \u201cI am from a small district in Odisha. What I had learnt in Odiya is what my son was learning at school in English. Nothing much has changed. And, that moment I realised that I wanted to give my son the best platform to learn.\u201dKuldeep, a digital entrepreneur, decided to home-school his son, Venkat Raman. He had an inkling that Venkat would engage with software. So when he chanced upon a Facebook advertisement in March for WhiteHat Jr\u2019s coding classes, he signed him up for it.\u201cIt was difficult in the beginning,\u201d says Venkat, who was introduced to concepts such as commands, sequences and code structure. \u201cA few weeks later, I started liking it.\u201dKaran Bajaj, the founder of WhiteHat Jr, says there are over 100 apps already on Google\u2019s Play Store created by students who use his platform.Karan, the former CEO of Discovery India Network, started WhiteHat Jr in November last year to enable young people to create, rather than merely consume, technology. The live online coding classes help children aged six to 14 to design games, animations and apps. The startup claims to have over 500 teachers, conducting 1000-plus online classes every day.Mumbai\u2019s Hirranya Rajani, 7, has developed an application to help those with hearing impairment. When a user enters a word, the app shows the finger spelling for each letter in the word. \u201cMy brother always has to use a wheelchair. I wanted to help people like him in a way,\u201d she says. But Hirranya was intrigued by sign language. Hence, when she took up coding, she knew what she wanted to create.Vihaan Khera, 9, from Gurugram, is a bookworm. His app Book Barter, which is soon to be released on Play Store, is a platform for meeting fellow readers and exchanging books. \u201cIt will provide access to more books to all. Exchanging the books will not only save money, but will also save the environment,\u201d he says.WhiteHat Jr apart, there are avenues aplenty for young people in India to learn coding. CodingZen, based in New Delhi, offers courses for children, aged five to 14, and adults. Noida-based Qin1 offers spoken English classes apart from coding. Many of the teachers these companies employ are from reputed institutions such as the Indian Institute of Technology. With digital addiction fast becoming a common problem, should a parent exercise caution before enrolling their child in these online classes?\u201cOf course, too much of anything is bad,\u201d says Qin1\u2019s co-founder Ishan Gupta. \u201cWe live, however, in an age where children are exposed to technology. The question is: \u2018how to make it constructive?\u2019\u201d. He reckons children benefit from interacting with teachers in the online classes. So far, he adds, Qin1 has had over 2,000 enrolments. In the next five years, he wants to reach over a million children in India.Contrary to the conjecture that coding is a complex subject, WhiteHat Jr\u2019s Karan says children pick it up easily. These online classes simplify coding with block-based programming. Unlike traditional coding, like Python, the programming commands are represented in graphical blocks. The children, hence, aren\u2019t required to know the entire syntax of the programming language.Meanwhile, Venkat from Balangir is on the verge of completing an app that attempts to foster positive habits in children. He explains, a child, with his/her parents and teachers, can create a list of positive and negative actions in the app and set points for them. \u201cFor example, you get five points for keeping your room tidy and minus five points for using the tablet without your parents\u2019 permission,\u201d he says.Venkat says he took five days to design and 10 days to code the app. He expects to release the app on Google Play Store soon.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nA SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket lifts off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Monday, Nov. 11, 2019, in Cape Canaveral, Fla. SpaceX launched 60 mini satellites on Monday, the second batch of an orbiting network meant to provide global internet coverage.\n | Photo Credit: \nAP\n SpaceX launched 60 mini satellites Monday, the second batch of an orbiting network meant to provide global internet coverage. The Falcon rocket blasted into the morning sky, marking the unprecedented fourth flight of a booster for SpaceX. The compact flat-panel satellites just 575 pounds (260 kg) each will join 60 launched in May. SpaceX founder and Chief Executive Elon Musk wants to put thousands of these Starlink satellites in orbit, to offer high-speed internet service everywhere. He plans to start service next year in the northern U.S. and Canada, with global coverage for populated areas after 24 launches. Last month, Mr. Musk used an orbiting Starlink satellite to send a tweet- \u201cWhoa, it worked!!\u201d Employees gathered at company bases on both coasts cheered when the first-stage booster landed on a floating platform in the Atlantic. \u201cThese boosters are designed to be used 10 times. Let\u2019s turn it around for a fifth, guys,\u201d company\u2019s launch commentator said. This also marked the first time SpaceX used a previously flown nose cone. The California-based company reuses rocket parts to cut costs. Stacked flat inside the top of the rocket, the newest satellites were going to maneuver even higher following liftoff, using krypton-powered thrusters. SpaceX said there was a potential problem with one of the 60 that could prevent it from moving beyond its initial 174 mile-high (280 km-high) orbit. In that case, the faulty satellite will be commanded to re-enter and burn up harmlessly in the atmosphere. Each satellite has an autonomous system for dodging space junk. In September, however, the European Space Agency had to move one of its satellites out of the way of a Starlink satellite. SpaceX later said it corrected the problem. SpaceX is among several companies interested in providing broadband internet coverage worldwide, especially in areas where it costs too much or is unreliable. Others include OneWeb and Jeff Bezos\u2019 Amazon. According to Mr. Musk, Starlink revenue can help SpaceX develop rockets and spacecraft for traveling to Mars, his overriding ambition.

      "\nInternet could be a key way of protecting other basic human rights such as life, liberty, and freedom from torture, says a study by University of Birmingham.\n | Photo Credit: \niStockphoto   Free internet access should be considered as a basic human right, according to a study which noted that people unable to get online \u2014 particularly in developing countries \u2014 lack meaningful ways to influence the global players shaping their everyday lives.Researchers from the University of Birmingham in the U.K. gave the example of Kerala, noting that the Indian state has declared universal internet access a human right and aims to provide it for its 35 million people by this year.Also read: Kerala govt. to provide free Internet to over 20 lakh BPL familiesAlso read: Where does Kerala's Internet access stand compared to other States?They explained that as political engagement increasingly takes place online, basic freedoms that many take for granted including free expression, freedom of information and freedom of assembly are undermined if some citizens have access to the internet and others do not.The study, published in the Journal of Applied Philosophy, shows that the internet could be a key way of protecting other basic human rights such as life, liberty, and freedom from torture \u2014 a means of enabling billions of people to lead \u2018minimally decent lives\u2019\u201cInternet access is no luxury, but instead a moral human right and everyone should have unmonitored and uncensored access to this global medium \u2014 provided free of charge for those unable to afford it,\u201d Merten Reglitz, a lecturer at the University of Birmingham, said in a statement.\u201cWithout such access, many people lack a meaningful way to influence and hold accountable supranational rule-makers and institutions,\u201d Reglitz said.The researchers noted that people without internet access don\u2019t have a say in the making of the rules they must obey and which shape their life chances.Reglitz added that exercising free speech and obtaining information was now heavily dependent on having internet access.The researchers said that much of today\u2019s political debate took place online and politically relevant information is shared on the internet \u2014 meaning the relative value these freedoms held for people \u2018offline\u2019 had decreased.The study attributes unprecedented possibilities to the internet for protecting basic human rights to life, liberty and bodily integrity, they said.While the researchers acknowledged that being online does not guarantee these rights, they cite examples of internet engagement that helped hold governments and institutions to account.These examples include the \u2018Arab Spring\u2019 which saw new ways of global reporting on government atrocities, the researchers said.They also gave the example of the #MeToo campaign which helped to \u2018out\u2019 sexual harassment of women by powerful men.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

Cyber security expert Dr Ananth Prabhu G, the author of the e-booklet that puts the spotlight on online safety of girls using graphic images, says, \u201cMen gain access to their private videos and photos and start manipulating them emotionally.\u201dInfo you can useLog on to cybersafegirl.com to download the free e-bookletWhile there, you can also enrol for an e-learning programme called 'cyber safe campus'. Once you go through a module, you have to take up a 30-minute online test to get a certificate that states that you are aware of staying safe from any kind of cyber crimeThe certificate issued by Information Security Education and Awareness(ISEA) under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, is valid for two yearsThe e-booklet has completed over 1.5 lakh downloads. They have also distributed 10,000 printed copies of the booklet at various educational institutionsWatch out for Profile hacking: A stalker takes over your email or social networking sites and manipulates itPicture morphing: A person\u2019s face is morphed on to a body image to intimidate herOnline games: People who suffer from self-esteem and clinical depression fall prey to dangerous online games, like \u2018Blue Whale\u2019, which becomes addictive and harms themCamera hacking: Phones with no camera guard can be exploited for such criminal activitiesKeylogger: A malicious programme that can collect all login details and other sensitive informationAnanth Prabhu created the content along with entrepreneur and social activist Vivek Shetty, and under the guidance of IPS officers Sanjay Sahay, S Murugan and Roopa D. \u201cEach infotoon has a set of nine sketches that describe situations where women lay themselves open to exploitation. For example, at mobile recharge shops. When they leave their number with the vendor for recharge, anyone in the shop can gain access to the number and start harassing them with calls and lewd messages,\u201d says Ananth, who is the cyber security trainer at the Karnataka Police Academy. \u201cThere is an increase in the number of online crimes against women, especially in the last three years. We picked these 25 common crimes based on the calls from women for help. A quantum of the calls are from women whose profiles have been hacked or their pictures morphed. The experience is harrowing, but it is an avoidable one. All it needs is awareness,\u201dsays Ananth.\n\n\n\n\n\nCyber security expert Dr. Anath Prabhu G \n| Photo Credit: \nSpecial Arrangement  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe e-booklet in the first version carried 15 sketches. \u201cWe added 10 more sketches in the second version and there are plans to add more in version three. In the second phase, we updated the booklet.There is an exclusive section called bonus tips that tells one how to safeguard against cyber crimes. We have added 39 various sections of the IT Act and the Indian Penal Code (IPC) under which the 25 crimes can be tried. There is also information on how to prevent or deal with situations where one is harassed with pornographic content.\u201dAnanth says awareness has to begin at schools. \u201cUnfortunately, most schools don't have cyber security in their syllabus. There is Information Technology Act, but no one bothers to learn it. One often ends up doing cyber crimes without being aware of their actions online.\u201dWatch out...Profile hacking: A stalker takes over your email or social networking sites and manipulates itPicture morphing: A person\u2019s face is morphed on to a body image to intimidate herOnline games: People who suffer from self-esteem and clinical depression fall prey to dangerous online games, like \u2018Blue Whale\u2019, which becomes addictive and harms themCamera hacking: Phones with no camera guard can be exploited for such criminal activitiesKeylogger: A malicious programme that can collect all login details and other sensitive information.The infotoons highlight cyber stalking, camera hacking, trolling, SMS spoofing and call spoofing where anyone can become a soft target. He gives an example of how an old women was spoofed to believe that her son is in trouble. \u201cShe received a call from a stranger, but from her son\u2019s number who is working in Dubai. He tells her to deposit a few lakhs of money in a bank account of a friend to free her son from the customs officials. She transfers the money and then learns about her folly.\u201dIn some situations, it is one\u2019s family reputation or social status that is at stake. \u201cThere is something called deep fakes. That is child\u2019s play. With the help of high-end filters, photo editors, printers, scanners, apps and other software anyone can pick your video, use your input to manipulate, blackmail and dupe you and your dear ones. This is an advance level of picture morphing which can have dangerous consequences,\u201d he explains.Exercise caution, says Ananth. \u201cAvoid posting close-up selfies. Instead, post a low resolution group photo. Be wary of suspicious e-mails or requests that asks you to share your photos.\u201d Ananth\u2019s mission is to create a cyber-safe India. He adds, \u201cInternet can be be a \u2018terrible master\u2019 or an \u2018excellent slave\u2019. It's a double-edged sword.

      "What do Sanjeev Bikhchandani, Deep Kalra, Deepinder Goyal and Ashish Hemrajani have in common? The founders of Naukri.com, MakeMyTrip, Zomato and BookMyShow are not only some of India\u2019s biggest entrepreneurs, but have also overcome near-fiascos with quick thinking and occasionally, sheer dumb luck. Sidharth Rao, co-founder of Webchutney, and an active angel investor, has documented their stories in his new book, How I Almost Blew It, published by Westland. He was recently in Chennai\u2019s Madras Management Association, to release the book, along with Bharat Matrimony founder Murugavel Janakiraman, who also features in the book. \u201cWe hear many success stories about entrepreneurs. Media reports either vanity milestones like achieving funding, or, on the opposite spectrum, tragedies like mass layoffs,\u201d said Sidharth. \u201cBut the journey of a startup is much more nuanced than that, and I wanted to trace that.\u201dThrough the course of the book, Sidharth noted common themes that emerged, like the overconfidence that comes with sitting on a lot of capital for the first time, and fights between co-founders in a startup environment where roles are not clearly defined.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeing what moderator Anant Rangaswami jokingly termed as a \u2018serial gambler\u2019, Sidharth\u2019s many initiatives too have seen many near-death experiences \u2014 each churning out crucial life lessons. He started Webchutney, making websites for people, at the age of 19. \u201cWe started at the peak of the dot com bubble. It was a time when everyone and their aunts and uncles wanted websites for their companies. We thought the party would last forever,\u201d he said. But the eventual dot com crash happened, post 2000, and their company had to tide over it. So it was with the 2008 financial crisis.\u201cBack in those days, when we had just started,\u201d he recalled, \u201cwe did not have enough money to book flight tickets, so we had the Rajdhani train schedule memorised. Clients would call us for meetings in other cities the very next day, and we would have to book tickets before 2 pm. Oh, and the hotels we stayed at! One in Mumbai got raided by ATS, who were very suspicious of our computer work!\u201dIt is essential that we look back at our journey and see if we fall into patterns, he emphasised. In How I Almost Blew It, he shared his own and got his peers to do the same.How I Almost Blew It is available online for \u20b9460.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nIn the past few days, Mastodon has been seeing a considerable influx of Indian users, who have labelled the platform as a more egalitarian social network.\n | Photo Credit: \nOfficial Mastodon Blog (https://blog.joinmastodon.org/\n Mastodon, founded on October 5, 2016 by Eugen Rochko, calls itself a \u201cfederation\u201d comprising thousands of communities, similar to Reddit and with timelines much like Twitter. Like any social network, users can create profiles, post images, messages and videos, all while following other users.In a way, it has that Reddit-like feel with the open-source properties. Expressing yourself works differently too \u2013 unlike Twitter\u2019s 280-character count, Mastodon offers a 500-character space for users to express themselves.The etymology of Mastodon alludes to the mammoth-like extinct creature which is the platform\u2019s avatar. Perhaps the name of the platform refers to its indescribably large size.No, Mastodon is not new by any means. In fact they\u2019ve undergone many revisions over the past couple of years, learning from the masses and by continually developing their infrastructure. Mastodon 3.0 now promises a \u201csafer social media experience\u201d equipped with effective anti-abuse tools to protect yourself and other users from harassment as well as servers with strict codes of conduct. There are also more moderators involved in the upkeep of the platform.Also read: Campaign against Twitter by Dalit activistsMastodon\u2019s pull-factor lies in its infrastructure; so we will compare it with Twitter to make it a little more comprehensive. Twitter is centralised, meaning all interactions take place on a single server controlled by one company... but Mastodon is decentralised, meaning it is a collection of many instances which communicate with each other to form a wider network. Each of these instances, per se, have their own admin with its own policies. In this sense, it is \u2018federated.\u2019In a July 2018 blog post for JoinMastodon.org, Rochko shared he used Twitter\u2019s model to further Mastodon\u2019s development. \u201cVery early on in the development of Mastodon I\u2019ve decided that centralisation and unexpected algorithmic changes were not the only one of Twitter\u2019s problems. Harassment and tools to deal with it have always been lacking on Twitter\u2019s end.\u201d Obviously Twitter has evolved since then, creating blocking and reporting tools with permanent effects. \n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nMastodon happening in India\n\n\n\n\n\nMastodon happening in India\nRochko also added, in the same post, \u201cI need to delineate that the design decisions are more about what the software nudges you towards, rather than a tamper-proof barrier against some behaviours, which is not possible. Mastodon deliberately does not support arbitrary search... What does arbitrary search accomplish? People and brands search for their own name to self-insert into conversations they were not invited to.\u201d \n\nThere\u2019s been a lot of discussion this week about Twitter's perceived bias in India. To be clear, whether it's the development of policies, product features, or enforcement of our Rules, we are impartial and do not take action based upon any ideology or political viewpoint.\u2014 Twitter India (@TwitterIndia) November 7, 2019 \n\n\nThere\u2019s been a lot of discussion this week about Twitter's perceived bias in India. To be clear, whether it's the development of policies, product features, or enforcement of our Rules, we are impartial and do not take action based upon any ideology or political viewpoint.This explains why, in the past few days, Indian users have labelled Mastodon as a more egalitarian social network. After the suspension of SC lawyer Sanjay Hegde\u2019s Twitter account (not once, but twice) for opinion taken out of context, users have accused Twitter of being inconsistent with its strict policies.Mastodon is comprised of individual servers, called instances, as opposed to a centralised server, the model used by platforms like Twitter.Instances like mastodon.xyz and mastodon.social are more general in its outlook: anyone can join. Other instances are restrictive in focus, which are meant for people who share specific interests, such as say, MotoGP fans.Each instance is an individual server, which is run by its owner, who moderates it, besides controlling membership to the instance, and the content that is allowed on it. For example, inditoot.com is a social network for Indians, run by Indian owners on a specific Mastodon instance, which is denoted by \u201cinditoot\u201d.Can users from one instance communicate with users from another instance? Sure. If User A from instance Red wants to communicate to user B from another instance, say, Blue, they simply add the B\u2019s Mastodon handle followed by their instance name to their \u201ctoot\u201d. In this case, it will be @B@Blue. If B wants to communicate to A, he or she will add @A@Red to their toot.Instances are not readily visible to every other instance. A pair of instances will communicate with each other only if there is a connection between a user on one instance ( i.e., a local user) and a user on the target instance.In such a case, the two instances is said to form a \u2018federation\u2019. Another policy that the owners of an instance can frame is the rules for the \u2018federated timeline\u2019 of the users of their instance. Going back to the earlier example, since person A of instance Blue follows person B of the Red instance, the federated timeline of instance Blue will now include posts from instance Red (note: the federated timeline is different from the instance-specific, or local timeline, which will contain posts by the users of that specific instance alone). This, unless the owner of instance Blue chooses to ban/prevent posts from instance Red.Since complete freedom is given to owners to moderate the kind of content that is available to users of an instance, it naturally follows that users of a particular instance are usually like-minded, or know what they are signing up for when they join a particular instance.The most recommended way for getting started with Mastodon is to sign up and join its flagship instance \u2014 mastodon.social \u2014 to get a feel of the platform.Mastodon does not have an official app. On JoinMastodon.org, one can browse Mastodon-compatible apps for Android, iOS, web, desktop and SailfishOS. Once you download the app compatible with your phone\u2019s operating system, you can sign up and start browsing the instance of your choice.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nBackground of famous social media icons. File\n | Photo Credit: \nGetty Images\n Amid an allegation of caste-based bias and content moderation against Twitter, many Indians are now looking at its lesser know rival, Mastodon. In fact, Mastodon was among the top Twitter trends as people announced their new accounts, while encouraging others to do the same.Mastodon is very similar to Twitter or Tumblr where users can make their profiles and post messages, images or videos on the platform. They can also follow accounts that they want. However, while one \u2018tweets\u2019 on Twitter, on Mastodon the users \u2018toot\u2019 with up to 500 characters.Meanwhile, what is drawing people to it is the fact that it is a decentralised open source platform, meaning there is no one server, company or a person running it. Instead, users can create and run their own servers. Hence, Mastodon is made up of many servers, with each having its set of rules. Users can choose to interact just within these specific servers or with all servers across the platform. The network has no ads. There are also no blue tick verifications on the platform.Also read: What is Mastodon, the new social media kid on the blockWhile exactly how many Indians have opened accounts on Mastodon as part of the trend is unknown, Mastodon early on Friday, in a tweet, said, \u201cWe are seeing a lot of interest and activity in the current migration to Mastodon.\u201dOn Mastodon, its founder @Gargon or Eugen Rochko, in a \u2018toot\u2019 invited applications for a moderator who speaks Hindi for mastodon.social team. \u201cMust uphold our code of conduct, must stick around on Mastodon, some monetary compensation is included,\u201d he said.The upsurge in the trend to move from Twitter is mainly attributed to the suspension of Supreme Court lawyer Sanjay Hegde\u2019s account by Twitter. Mr. Hegde told The Hindu that Twitter had brought in a PR disaster on itself by refusing to listen. He said that apart from a junior official of Twitter no one else spoke to him. And this official too \u201ctalked down\u201d to him.Mr. Hegde said he may or may not return to Twitter, and that Mastodon, \u201cThankfully, right now it looks free of the toxic hate that threatens to overwhelm Twitter India.\u201d Mastodon was a federated experience and its moderators would be among users themselves, he observed.\u201cTwitter is behaving indifferently on suspension of Sanjay Hegde's account. It seems they are toeing the government's line alone. There is no space for an alternate narrative on Twitter, so it is only obvious that users will switch to other platforms,\u201d DMK MP from Villupuram V.C. Ravi Kumar \u2013 who was among the first MPs to join Mastodon, said.Meanwhile, an official account of Rahul Gandhi also popped up on Mastodon with toots on the three year anniversary of demonetisation. However, Rohan Gupta, social media in-charge of the Congress said, \u201cThat's not our official account. We have reported to the platform informing them that it is not us. We were surprised to see verification of Rahul Gandhi's account without following any authentication process.\u201dYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "An actor has filed a complaint at Goregaon police station accusing an unidentified person of allegedly hacking his WhatsApp account and using his number to make obscene video calls to his friends and colleagues, a police official said on Wednesday.Based on the actor\u2019s complaint, the Goregaon police on Tuesday registered an FIR against the unidentified person under Section 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult modesty of a woman) of the Indian Penal Code, and provisions of the Information Technology Act, the official said.Sanchay Goswami, who has worked in films and television serials, told the police that someone gained unauthorised access to his WhatsApp account and converted it into a business account. The hacker then started sending obscene messages and making video calls to his friends, the official said. One of his female friends received a video call in which a man was seen masturbating. She immediately informed the actor about it.Mr. Goswami suspects that his Whatsapp account was hacked while he was returning from the Mumbai airport at 12.15 a.m. on Monday. The actor said he received a six-digit OTP (one-time password) on his mobile phone, but he ignored the message.He then received a call from an international number and thought it was from his brother in the U.S. The cell phone screen displayed a computer generated six-digit pin and he disconnected the call. He then started getting more calls and OTPs and his phone eventually switched off.Mr. Goswami said, \u201cThen I started getting calls from my friends and family members on my alternate number asking whether my WhatsApp account had been hacked.\u201d It was then that he learnt that his friends had been receiving obscene messages and video calls from his mobile number. The actor said a few of his friends also received OTPs and spam messages. Mr. Goswami rushed to Goregaon police station and submitted a complaint after his colleagues also started receiving obscene calls and messages on WhatsApp, the police official said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2019I am sorry\u2019: A message posted by the actor on Facebook apologising to his friends and family members.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe actor said he then posted a message on all his social media accounts, including Instagram and Facebook, apologising to his friends and family members and asking them not to accept any WhatsApp calls from his number.\u201cWe have registered the FIR and an investigation is under way,\u201d the police official said.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      " Two former employees of Twitter and a third man from Saudi Arabia face U.S. charges of spying for the kingdom by digging up private user data and giving it to Saudi officials in exchange for payment, according to a complaint filed on Wednesday.Ali Alzabarah and Ahmad Abouammo, who used to work for Twitter, and Ahmed Almutairi, who then worked for the Saudi royal family, face charges of working for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia without registering as foreign agents, according to a complaint filed against them.According to the complaint, Abouammo repeatedly accessed the Twitter account of a prominent critic of the Saudi royal family in early 2015. At one instance, he was able to view the email address and telephone number associated with the account. He also accessed the account of a second Saudi critic to get personally identifiable information.\u201cThis information could have been used to identify and locate the Twitter users who published these posts,\u201d the Justice Department said in a news release.Saudi Arabia, a key U.S. ally in confronting Iran, has faced intense Western criticism over its human rights record, including over last year's murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and its involvement in the devastating war in Yemen.Almutairi, for his part, is accused of acting as a go-between for the Saudi government and the Twitter employees.Abouammo is under arrest in Seattle, Washington while the other two are in Saudi Arabia, the department said.The two men were given cash and other rewards, such as an expensive watch, for the information, the complaint said.The Saudi embassy did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Twitter said that it was grateful to the FBI and U.S. Justice Department. \u201cWe recognize the lengths bad actors will go to try and undermine our service,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cWe understand the incredible risks faced by many who use Twitter to share their perspectives with the world and to hold those in power accountable.\u201dYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nThe Twitter logo\n | Photo Credit: AP  Accused of promoting and condoning caste discrimination and hierarchy, social medial platform Twitter is in the eye of a storm as a campaign against it by Dalit, OBC and tribal activists and their supporters has been trending on the platform since Saturday. On Tuesday, #TwitterHatesSCSTOBCMuslims was among the top trends and on Monday, it was #JaiBheemJaiMandalJaiBirsa \u2014 denoting a coalition of Dalits, OBCs and Tribals hailing Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, B.P. Mandal of Mandal Commission fame, and Birsa Munda, tribal freedom fighter. Campaigners have trended #CasteistTwitter, #JaiBhimTwitter and #SackManishMaheswari since Saturday. Manish Maheshwari is the managing director of Twitter India.Meanwhile, another hashtag #TwitterParRajHinduKa \u2014 Hindus rule Twitter \u2014 had begun to trend by Tuesday afternoon. Activists say the immediate trigger for the campaign was Twitter\u2019s abrupt decision to restrict the handle of Dilip Mandal, academic, journalist and author who champions social justice causes online. Mr. Mandal told The Hindu that his account was disabled by Twitter on Friday, alleging privacy violation. \u201cIn March this year, I had tweeted about a booklet titled Bahujan Agenda including the contact details of the author. The author had explicitly given me permission to tweet his contacts, but Twitter cited that as a violation of rules and restricted my account,\u201d he said. Social justice activists started a campaign #restoreDilipMandal and when it began trending, Twitter restored the account on Saturday. The platform also verified Mr. Mandal\u2019s account.Mr. Mandal, who has since called for removing the verification tick from his handle, said through this process, Twitter was mirroring the Varna system, authenticating the voice of some and silencing others. \u201cVerified handles spew venom against Dalits, tribals, OBCs and Muslims and the company does not act. It shuts down accounts that call for ending discrimination. Anecdotal evidence suggest that this is caste bias and religious prejudice,\u201d he said. Twitter campaigners against the company point out that it has not verified the accounts of film director Pa Ranjith \u2014 who has more than eight lakh followers \u2014 Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi leader Prakash Ambedkar and Bheem Army leader Chandra Shekhar Aazad and a host of other vocal proponents of lower caste rights. \u201cWe would like to know whether Twitter has any criteria for verifying an account or is it arbitrary as it appears,\u201d said Mr. Mandal. \u201cTwitter has the power to mould and influence public opinion. I have no empirical data, but it clearly smacks of caste and communal prejudice on the part of the company.\u201d Campaigners have put the spotlight on several other accounts to drive home the point that there is some unstated and underlying bias in the verification process.Replying to queries sent, a Twitter spokesperson said, the company has one set of rules and it enforces them \u201cjudiciously and impartially for all individuals \u2014 regardless of their political beliefs, religious ideology, professional position or background.\u201d\u201cWe have ongoing efforts to provide local market context when developing and enforcing our global policies. We extensively cover gender and religion (including caste) in our trainings, to provide reviewers with the local context they need to evaluate content. Our policy prohibits behaviour that targets individuals based on protected categories (including caste),\u201d the spokesperson added. On the issue of verification, the Twitter spokesperson said the public verification process is currently closed. \u201cHowever, on a case-by-case basis we do verify people who are active in the public conversation on Twitter.\u201dYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nIn this image made from a video provided by NASA the Starliner capsule rests on the ground after a test of Boeing's crew capsule's launch abort system in White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico on Monday, Nov. 4, 2019. The capsule carried no astronauts Monday morning, just a test dummy.  | Photo Credit: \nAP/NASA\n  Boeing Co said on Monday that one of three parachutes failed to open during a crucial unmanned test of the CST-100 Starliner, which the company is developing to ferry astronauts to and from the International Space Station.The deployment failure happened during a test of a system designed to propel the crew to safety in the event of an emergency, Boeing spokesman Todd Blecher said by email.\u201cIt's too early to determine why all three main parachutes did not deploy,\u201d Blecher said. \u201cHowever, having two of three deploy successfully is acceptable for the test parameters and crew safety.\u201dBoeing and U.S. space agency NASA said they were still targeting Dec. 17 for the Starliner's first unpiloted mission to the International Space Station.NASA has picked Boeing and Elon Musk's SpaceX as the main contractors to build rocket-and-capsule launch systems to return Americans to the orbiting research lab for the first time since the U.S. space shuttle program ended in 2011.Parachute deployment has been among the top technical challenges both companies have faced that have raised questions over crew safety and pressured launch schedules. The parachutes are designed to slow down the capsules when they return to Earth at supersonic speeds.SpaceX is working to fly its Crew Dragon capsule on a first manned test flight into orbit in the first quarter of next year, after completing its unmanned test in March, the company and NASA have said.

      "EnglishHelper\u2019s RightToRead programme hopes to reach 20 million Government students by 2020",
      "Updated: November 4, 2019 18:31 IST\rPublished: November 4, 2019 18:31 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/education/englishhelper-edt-tech-india-working-across-government-schools/article29879935.ece",
      " It is time for English period for students of Class VII in Chennai Middle School, MGR Nagar. Instead of pulling out their textbooks from their bags and waiting for the teacher to walk in, the students sit facing a projector screen. Their textbook plays out on the screen and they sit glued to it, as a recorded voice reads out the spelling of the word \u2018surrounded\u2019 slowly, pausing after every letter. The boys and girls, dressed in maroon and cream-coloured uniforms, repeat after the voice in gusto. They will probably never forget the word\u2019s spelling.EnglishHelper, an education company, has made this possible. Its RightToRead initiative, launched in 2013, reads out English textbooks with the help of ReadToMe, powered by Artificial Intelligence. Says Sanjay Gupta, the company\u2019s global CEO, \u201cWe learn languages in a multi-sensory way. Even before we learn to speak, we listen to sounds, relate it to everyday objects; we then move on to exposure to the written aspect \u2014 our software has been designed taking this multi-sensory aspect into account.\u201dBreaking the barrierSanjay hopes that by 2020, 20 million students in 100,000 schools use their RightToRead programme.The software can be used offline and across multiple devices and systems, such as the PC, Linux, and Android.Two years after the launch in 2013, the programme reached 5,000 schools in eight states, covering one million students.In Maharashtra, RightToRead is being implemented in 65,000 schools, while the numbers stand at 300 in Tamil Nadu.Sanjay, who is based in Gurugram and has worked for large corporations in India and around the globe, decided to take the plunge into education in 2010. \u201cI met Venkat Srinivasan, a Boston-based entrepreneur and cognitive scientist of Indian origin in 2009, who was working on an interesting technology for learning English,\u201d he recalls. Venkat is the founder of EnglishHelper and when the two of them met again two years later, Sanjay decided to join the team full-time. \u201cOur pilot programme, which launched in 2013, covered six states in India,\u201d he explains. The programme has grown multi-fold today, reaching more than 3.5 million students across 15,000 schools, according to data shared by the company. Given this data-driven mission, for 2017-18, the team did impact analyses \u2014 with 20 schools in South Delhi Municipal Corporation, 10 schools in Uttar Pradesh and 11 schools in Telangana \u2014 across various grades.EnglishHelper has a simple goal: to make the teaching and learning of English easier in Government schools. To do so, Sanjay says that all the school requires is \u201cone computer and a projector\u201d. He adds that the institution can have a dedicated room which students can take turns to make use of during their English class.The company partners with various agencies to take its mission forward. These include the United States Agency for International Development. In Tamil Nadu, for instance, RightToRead was launched in partnership with American India Foundation. In certain districts such as Thoothukudi, Kanyakumari, Tirunelveli and The Nilgiris, the programme is being sponsored by the local administration.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, how does it work? Once the school partners with EnglishHelper, it can send its prescribed English textbooks to be worked on by their software. Once this is done, the teacher can teach lessons by projecting the book onto a screen, and the ReadToMe software will read out every word, the speed of which can be altered according to students\u2019 needs. The control lies with teachers. \u201cThey can highlight words, change the pace of the recorded voice, translate words into Tamil, and so on,\u201d Sanjay explains.And all this happens during the class\u2019 English period. \u201cStudents can learn the language more easily and syllabus is covered as well,\u201d he points out. He adds that teachers have been supportive: \u201cTeachers are all for technology-enabled solutions,\u201d he says, adding that the initiative has been able to do away with fear for the language among certain students.Back at the Chennai Middle School, the class is almost over and the teacher asks a child to spell the new word they learnt. \u201cS-u-r-r-o-u-n-d-e-d,\u201d says a girl in two long braids, to applause from her classmates. She gets back to her seat, a smile forming on her lips.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "Mobvoi TicWatch Pro review: Good to go",
      "Updated: November 5, 2019 12:24 IST\rPublished: November 4, 2019 18:07 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/review-mobvoi-ticwatch-pro-2019-good-to-go/article29879599.ece",
      "It has become almost an existential question now: do you really need a smartwatch? The short answer is yes. The long answer is that even if you are not fartlek-ing (interval training) it is best to have an exercise routine, and a device helps you to get excited about, say, doing a 4k in 30 minutes, to push yourself to do more, or to checking with your doc if your resting heart rate is always in the 90s (it should be between 50 and 100). Now to the TicWatch Pro from Mobvoi, a smartwatch (launched last year abroad) that took me time to get used to its bulk. On the bright side, it has a large screen, so it is easily readable if you\u2019re on the verge of long-sightedness. The strap is leather on the outside and silicone on the inside, so sweat doesn\u2019t ruin the leather. It has also got an IP68 rating i.e. the highest possible Ingress Protection against dust (the first number) and water (the second number). Drop the device into water up to 1.5 metres deep for half an hour and it should come out okay.Powered by Wear OS by Google, it syncs easily with an Android device, so you get mobile notifications and can see messages and take calls. I didn\u2019t find I needed to take a call on the device, because I used it for fitness and to keep a track of my lifestyle: to measure steps (generally set to target 10,000), exercise (at least 30 minutes) and check heart rate (should be between 60 and 100 at rest). It is helpful that it has GPS, so on a walk or run, you don\u2019t need to carry your phone. You can also download Spotify or Google Play Music. The problem like in most of these devices, is that it measures steps even when you\u2019re driving, so if you\u2019re going long distance, best to take the watch off.SpecificationsChipset: Qualcomm Snapdragon WearOperating System: Wear OS by GoogleBattery capacity: 415mAhDisplay: 1.39\u201d AMOLED 400 x 400 + FSTN displayOne of the good things about the device is that even when the battery dies, it converts into a regular watch, so you can check on the time. There is also an essential mode which helps you save battery life. In this mode, it will only tell you the time and give you footsteps. On regular smartphone mode though, you will get a day-and-a-half of juice, especially if you are constantly waking up the phone with a flick of the wrist (yes, there is gesture control) .I enjoyed that the watch detects a workout, so begins recording a run without you having to programme it. It also has a walking, freestyle workout, and cycling mode, though it once recorded that I\u2019d cycled 60 miles in 60 minutes, which made me think I was The Flash. Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t have an interval workout mode, nor can you swim with it. But it will tell you what distance you\u2019ve walked, your active hours and calories burnt.The Find My Phone, Flashlight, TicSleep (that tracks sleep), and FitBreathe (you take a break and just breathe) options are useful. It\u2019s a useful device, but at something over \u20b920k, I\u2019d have hoped to be able to take it into the pool too.Mobvoi\u2019s TicWatch Pro is priced at \u20b922,999 and can be purchased from major online retailersYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "What impact can India\u2019s youth expect from Twitter banning political ads?",
      "Updated: November 4, 2019 17:09 IST\rPublished: November 4, 2019 17:01 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/what-impact-can-indias-youth-expect-from-twitter-banning-political-ads/article29878940.ece",
      "Scrolling through Twitter and seeing the mention of \u2018Thread\u2019 means there is juice to a story, which cannot be confined to 280 characters. One person who does not need to fuel a fire like that is Jack Dorsey.On October 31, many woke up to the Twitter CEO\u2019s announcement that political advertising is a no-go on the platform, and much of it has to do with the capitalist culture within a \u2014 supposedly \u2014 democratised space. \u201cA political message earns reach when people decide to follow an account or re-tweet. Paying for reach removes that decision, forcing highly optimised and targeted political messages on people. We believe this decision should not be compromised by money... This is not about free expression. This is about paying for reach. And paying to increase the reach of political speech has significant ramifications that today\u2019s democratic infrastructure may not be prepared to handle.\u201d This is a 180-degree move from Twitter\u2019s decision on February 19 to extend their Ads Transparency model to India, which allowed anyone around the globe to view ads that have been served on Twitter, with even more details on political campaigning ads, including ad spend and targeting demographics. \n\nWe\u2019ve made the decision to stop all political advertising on Twitter globally. We believe political message reach should be earned, not bought. Why? A few reasons\u2026\u2014 jack (@jack) October 30, 2019 \n\n\nWe\u2019ve made the decision to stop all political advertising on Twitter globally. We believe political message reach should be earned, not bought. Why? A few reasons\u2026Dorsey says these online ads present \u2014 with \u201cincreasing velocities, sophistications, and overwhelming scales\u201d \u2014 wholly new challenges to civic discourse, such as Machine Learning-based optimisation of messaging and micro-targeting, unchecked misleading information, and, not to mention, DeepFakes.The pull of political ads may make sense for many tweeters who are annoyed with the littering of \u2018Promoted\u2019 political content. Gone are the days of flexis being the go-to messaging for parties. Tweets, posts, stories, snaps... these are new hoardings. Dorsey adds, \u201cWe considered stopping only candidate ads, but issue ads present a way to circumvent. Additionally, it isn\u2019t fair for everyone but candidates to buy ads for issues they want to push. So we are stopping these too.\u201dTwitter obviously did not come up with the new changes overnight. On October 24, a week before the announcement was made, Twitter\u2019s public policy manager Ronan Costello announced the platform is building a partnership with UNESCO on media and information literacy. This 18-month project comes to fruition in the form of a new handbook for educators, Teaching and Learning with Twitter, which is available in nine languages, including Hindi.This handbook hopes to drive young people \u2014 using the digital classroom known as the Internet \u2014 \u201cto ask the right questions about content they engage with online, and critically analyse news and information they engage with on the service,\u201d writes Ronan, in a blog post that same day. Before the problem of incumbents came about, the platform clearly thought of a significant deterrence.\n\n\n\n\n\nMoez Chakchouk \n\n\n\n\n\nMoez Chakchouk, assistant director-general of UNESCO, explains in the blog post, \u201cPolarised information is driving a rise in hate and discrimination and is often amplified by inauthentic and malicious activity, while disinformation is compromising democracy and development. Promoting media and information literacy learning through social media platforms, such as this Twitter and UNESCO collaboration, could be far-reaching if systematically implemented and sustained.\u201dHowever, Radhika Ganesh, activist and convener at national organisation Young People For Politics \u2014 which develops a working system that facilitates positive generational influx into politics \u2014 doesn\u2019t believe this move will amount to anything, suggesting that this was a way for Twitter to cover their bases.While Dorsey understands Twitter is a small part of the greater political ads ecosystem, he adds, \u201cSome might argue our actions today could favour incumbents. But we have witnessed many social movements reach massive scale without any political advertising.\u201d It is worth pointing out that there is no tangible evidence of the effect political advertising has on people. It can be argued that there are more confronting advertisements around sexual health or popular culture out there.\n\n\n\n\n\nSrivatsa YB, the National Campaign in-charge of Indian Youth Congress and former social media head of Karnataka Congress, points out political advertising on Twitter is not so big in India. \u201cFor the Karnataka Assembly elections, we didn\u2019t use it at all. Twitter advertising is mostly used by brands here. So, it doesn\u2019t affect our party much. Having said that, it is good that Twitter has come forward and said it is not going to make money off political ads. Facebook is more problematic with political ads and the spread of fake news. There should be regulation on Facebook and Instagram as well to create an even playing field.\u201dSimilarly, Sorav Jain, CEO of digital marketing agency echoVME, says, \u201cI don\u2019t think it will create a big impact in India. Political parties here don\u2019t use Twitter for advertising; it is mostly about campaigning and personal branding. Most of the politicians have their own IT wings. They participate in a trending hashtag or they make one trend. You are less likely to see them using promoted trends. The ban is only going to affect a new politician, who might try to increase his or her followers through paid ads. The ones who are already there on Twitter have established a base.\u201dRadhika Ganesh explains, \u201cThis is a deflection from the actual problem. Banning political ads, especially in India, won\u2019t have a massive impact; they\u2019re not the only political mobilisers,\u201d says Radhika, \u201cLook at the influencer market or individual tweets \u2014 we do not know what is real any more. Political ads have had some sort of a replacement effect, especially across the urban opinion-making classes. Social media is in the process of becoming an integral political tool. Paid ads play an important role, particularly for those who do not have access to these larger propaganda missionaries. Young candidates have made the most of social media to mobilise opinions for them. I don\u2019t, however, see a huge dent happening after this new policy.\u201dBilal Zaidi, the co-founder of political fund-raising platform OurDemocracy.in, feels marketing and advertising is an important part of communication. \u201cOurDemocracy.in is in the business of amplifying campaigns of newcomers in politics. They cannot afford ads in mainstream media. It is difficult. So, Facebook and Google marketing allows us to target a new audience.\u201dA dark numbers gameStocks-savvy people would have noticed that within just 12 hours of the announcement, Twitter shares dropped as far as 4%, before a further 1.8% lower in extended trading. Clearly, some parties were disappointed with potential advertising reach being snatched away.To the argument that Twitter ads influence voters, Zaidi says, \u201cThe question, ethically, is not whether \u2018advertising is okay or not\u2019; it is \u2018is there a level playing field?\u2019 We let people spend crores of rupees on Facebook ads, others aren\u2019t getting the same kind of visibility. We have been advocating the introduction of a cap on money that can be spent online. Digital marketing in politics creates opportunities for newcomers. We don\u2019t want it to end; we want it to be regulated.\u201dDorsey says that a final policy will be shared by November 15, and enforced from November 22. From what has been gathered, this may not change much for the platform. How people will interact with their feeds may be different, but in terms of action, given the issue isn\u2019t about free expression, one should note that this new policy doesn\u2019t stop political tweeting altogether, nor should it.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

Krishnan\n WhatsApp had informed the Indian government in September that 121 Indian users were targeted by the Israeli spyware Pegasus, but the IT Ministry has contended the information received from the messaging app earlier was inadequate and incomplete, according to sources.Sources at WhatsApp said the messaging platform has responded to the government\u2019s query last week, seeking an explanation to the Pegasus spyware that helped unnamed entities\u2019 hack into the phones of journalists and human rights activists across the world, including India.\n\n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nWhatsApp alerted Priyanka Gandhi on possible phone attack, says Congress\n\n\n\n\n\nWhatsApp alerted Priyanka Gandhi on possible phone attack, says Congress\nIT Ministry sources said they have received a reply from WhatsApp and are studying it, and that a view on it will be taken soon.While declining to comment on the details of the fresh response sent last week, sources in WhatsApp said the company had reached out to the government in September as well, its second alert on the issue after its communication in May.They said the Facebook-owned company had, in the September communication, flagged that 121 users in India had been impacted by the spyware.\n\n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018WhatsApp did not inform govt. of system breach\u2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018WhatsApp did not inform govt. of system breach\u2019\nIT Ministry officials said they had received communication from WhatsApp in the past, but maintained the information that came in earlier was inadequate, incomplete and full of technical jargons.WhatsApp did not respond to queries over the matter.The messaging giant, on Thursday, had said Indian journalists and human rights activists were among those globally spied upon by unnamed entities using an Israeli spyware Pegasus.\n\n\nAlso Read\n\n\n\n\n\nIn WhatsApp breach, follow the money trail\n\n\n\n\n\nIn WhatsApp breach, follow the money trail\nWhatsApp had said it is suing NSO Group, an Israeli surveillance firm, that is reportedly behind the technology that helped unnamed entities\u2019 hack into the phones of roughly 1,400 users, spanning four continents that included diplomats, political dissidents, journalists and senior government officials.However, WhatsApp did not say on whose behest the phones of journalists and activists across the world were targeted. Refusing to divulge identities of those targeted in India, WhatsApp had said it had, in May, stopped a highly sophisticated cyber attack that exploited its video calling system to send malware to its users.The spyware allegedly allows compromised devices to give access to a phone\u2019s camera, mic, messages, e-mails and even location data. The hackers could have access to contents of the entire device.WhatsApp had said it had sent a special message to about 1,400 users globally that it has \u201creason to believe were impacted by this attack to directly inform them about what happened\u201d. Over the past few days, several social activists in India have come forward and said they had received communication from WhatsApp in this regard.WhatsApp has over 1.5 billion users globally, of which India alone accounts for about 400 million.On Thursday, after WhatsApp\u2019s disclosure that the spyware had targeted Indian users as well, the Indian government had asked WhatsApp to explain the matter and list out measures that were taken by the app to protect the privacy of its users.While NSO has so far maintained that it only sold its \u201ctechnology to licensed government intelligence and law enforcement agencies\u201d, government officials have asserted that the Indian government has no dealings with the Israeli company.Government officials had also questioned the \u201csuspicious\u201d timing of the disclosure of the hacking incident, particularly against the backdrop of Supreme Court allowing the Centre three months to come up with rules to curb misuse of social media in the country, and the continued demand for bringing in traceability of originators of malicious content.\n\n\n\nWatch | Explained: Pegasus, the spyware that came in via WhatsApp\n\n\n \n\nfunction getPlayerID(isSubscribed){\nif(isSubscribed){\nreturn \"lUyqynWW\";\n}\nreturn \"HxxKTB2U\";\n}\nuserIdentify.then(function() {\tloadAsyncURL(\"https://media.thehindu.com/players/puN1HSgT-\"+getPlayerID(!isNonSubcribedUser())+\".js\");\t});\n\n\nYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "Netflix\u2019s Kathy Rokni describes how accessibility is a craft of its own ",
      "Updated: November 2, 2019 13:10 IST\rPublished: November 2, 2019 12:48 IST",
      "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/netflix-exclusive-interview-with-director-of-globalistion-kathy-rokni-about-accessibility-and-technology/article29862300.ece",
      "\nClose up Netflix website in laptop screen.  | Photo Credit: \nwutwhanfoto/ Getty Images  There is a moment in Black Mirror: Bandersnatch during which you have to choose between confiding in a therapist about trauma or staying mum. But the screen is, somehow, not as cluttered as you\u2019d expect it to be: especially if you\u2019re using Closed Captioning (CC) along with the pop-up text for the choices you must make. While some may brush it off as simple tech, it is really not.At production houses like Netflix, a major chunk of this is due to the work of the globalisation and accessibility departments. Accessibility, as a form of content production, is strategic to the formula for their content to stay relevant while connecting with digital audiences. In an exclusive interview with Weekend, Kathy Rokni, the company\u2019s director of globalisation, gets candid about inclusion on an innovative level.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does Netflix stay up-to-date with the legalities of accessibility and content delivery in each country/region to unify strategy?  Obviously, Netflix complies with accessibility laws in all countries, where they apply and exist. The reality is that not all countries have strong laws or have taken actions along these lines. Being a streaming service and having the advantage of using technology, we have the platform to improve the member experience for everyone. We started in the USA with Audio Description (AD) and CC because our goal is to become accessible to people in many more countries.\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven the mobile-exclusive plan in India, how do you ensure an uncluttered experience on a smaller screen? India is the first, and at present, the only country to have the mobile plan. We work with a very strong design team and a consumer insight team, whose jobs are to research the best ways of providing viewers with an immersive experience, visually, audio-wise and text-wise. As we learn from our members and from the research, we apply the findings to our products \u2014 mobile, in this case. It is an ever-growing process, and we hope to continuously improve. Have there been any challenges or roadblocks Netflix has experienced in terms of sensitivities? I wouldn\u2019t call them roadblocks, they are more sensitivities, as you said. As a company which started in the USA, we learned a lot from our global members, especially about how to connect them with great stories. One of our biggest learning points? The assumption that people want content that\u2019s familiar isn\u2019t accurate. You\u2019d think this was common knowledge but we\u2019ve observed a vast consumption of secondary assets \u2014 such as subtitling and dubbing. And members have returned to that content. \n\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve seen the warnings for those with photo-sensitive epilepsy, but do accessibility aspects seep into physical production like sound design and visualisation?Given we do a lot of AV testing, there\u2019s a strong discipline in leaning into innovation, learning and being at the edge of technology while making content. On a production level, there are \u2018best practices\u2019 that don\u2019t impact the creative content. For example, when we do our subtitling, we are conscious of boxing the text if the background on the screen is white. When adding classic films or series to your lineup, what measures does your team take to make this content accessible?Actually, the older content is quite permissive. Our hope as a content-maker is that more people enjoy it. Regardless of genre, we can always create the appropriate facilities, be it AD or CC. That\u2019s the beauty of content. In terms of licensed content, we work with our partners to get access to the secondary assets. In the case of, say, Friends, there\u2019s no AD though. Let\u2019s talk interactive films; Bandersnatch was a success and Netflix has more coming out soon. Have you done anything with interactive films to make them more accessible? We\u2019re definitely working on it. One of the things we\u2019ve just been doing, on the product side, is positioning the subtitles, or we can position the captioning so that it\u2019s still immersive and doesn\u2019t compete.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s get technical. Tell us about the process of creating audio descriptions (AD)To create audio descriptions, you need a script adaptor, a director and trained voice talent. Challenges include writing to fit gaps, while still leaving room for key silences and background sounds, editing on the fly, finding the right voice talent (for example: Female narrator for a male-heavy show to make differentiating easy, younger voices for kids\u2019 shows). A good example is the sequence in the house in SeE7 of Stranger Things, where the demogorgon attacks. There\u2019s a lot happening in that scene; and the demogorgon is CGI, of course. But the AD throws in short descriptions without overwhelming the sounds, so as to remain immersive. The job of an audio descriptions script adaptor is to explain the scene and the situation while paying attention to the creative intent \u2014 without it dominating dialogues or any of the background music, which are key to the content. There\u2019s a director for recording ADs, who directs the voice talent in a manner similar to a dubbing director. The ADs go through the same quality check as the language dubbing.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe kicked off our audio description initiative in English with Marvel\u2019s Daredevil \u2014about a blind superhero\u2014and have been increasing the number of shows/films we cover, as well as the languages we support. Today we support 10,000-plus hours of audio description on Netflix globally covering most of our originals and films, in up to 36 languages.Earlier this year, there was talk a Rumble Pak project which uses vibrations and haptics for mobile.  Innovation is at the heart of what we do at Netflix. We want to use it to not just tell better stories, but also to tell them to more people. Hack Day acts as a great platform for such innovations. And we look to see how these ideas can help make the experience better for our members. Rumble Pack was one of the most exciting things to come out of Hack Day this year. And mobile is exciting for us, as you know \u2014 with Smart Downloads, vertical previews, the mobile plan in India, adaptive streaming. So we continue to see how this can be made useful.

      "\nSeveral U.S. senators have recently noted concerns about censorship and data collection on TikTok\n | Photo Credit: \nReuters\n The U.S. government has opened a national security investigation into the Chinese-owned video app TikTok, The New York Times reported on Friday.The report, citing anonymous sources, said the review by an intergovernmental panel may be looking into whether the app, popular for its music videos, was sending data to China.The investigation is led by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., a government panel that reviews acquisitions in the United States by foreign companies, the report said. The news comes after lawmakers called for a review of the national security risks of TikTok, warning it could be used for spying by Beijing.A review could look into the acquisition in 2017 of TikTok, which at the time was known as Musical.ly, by Beijing-based ByteDance. The deal gave the Chinese company the app, which has been popular with youth for homemade karaoke videos and which now has an estimated 500 million users worldwide.Senator Marco Rubio welcomed news about the review. \u201cLast month I asked @USTreasury to conduct a CFIUS review of @tiktok_us,\u201d Mr. Rubio tweeted. \u201cBecause any platform owned by a company in #China which collects massive amounts of data on Americans is a potential serious threat to our country.\u201dSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and Republican Senator Tom Cotton last week suggested that TikTok\u2019s owner ByteDance could be forced to share user information with Chinese intelligence. \u201cWith over 110 million downloads in the U.S. alone, TikTok is a potential counterintelligence threat we cannot ignore,\u201d the two Senators said in a letter to acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire.The Senators also warned that TikTok could potentially be used to influence voters in next year\u2019s election.TikTok said it could not comment on any regulatory matter but noted that it \u201chas made clear that we have no higher priority than earning the trust of users and regulators in the U.S.\u201dYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.

      "\nVishal Shah, vice-president, product, Instagram, at a media interaction in Mumbai on Friday.\n | Photo Credit: Emmanual Yogini After Twitter announced that it would ban political advertising, Instagram has revealed its intention to go bullish on shopping and platforming influencers and businesses in India. The Facebook-owned social network giant hosted over 250 creators and marketers, including Priya Varrier and Mallika Dua, at an \u2018Instagram Experience\u2019 event in Mumbai on Friday.Instagram launched its \u2018Born to Instagram\u2019 initiative to discover creators from across the country, and help them leverage the platform for business. The \u2018Born to Instagram\u2019 will roll out in 15 cities, enabling creators from big and small cities to collaborate and provide them with mentorship opportunities. Vishal Shah, vice-president, product, Instagram, shared IPSOS India study according to which 95% of people contacted said Instagram helped them decide whether to buy a product or service. Encouraged by this, Instagram will start testing augmented reality-based shopping, first in the U.S., but no timeline has been set for an India launch. Mr. Shah said the social network platform has recently introduced several provisions to ensure the \u201cwell-being\u201d of its users. It is currently testing the removal of the number of likes that appear under a post. \u201cResearch shows people face a lot of pressure and competition from these likes,\u201d Mr. Shah said. To tackle online bullying, Instagram recently launched a \u2018restrict\u2019 feature, which protects the user\u2019s account from unwanted interactions, without completely blocking them. \u201cWhen you put a wall around your bully, you don\u2019t know what they are doing or whether they are bullying you through someone else\u2019s account,\u201d he said. In addition, Instagram is adding a comment warning, informing the user that their content may be considered offensive, giving them a chance to review their comment.You have reached your limit for free articles this month.Register to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.
