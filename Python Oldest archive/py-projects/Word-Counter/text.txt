1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,970
in the last presentation we saw one

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:05,970



3
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:09,150
example by using the zeros by grouping

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:09,150



5
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:12,059
the zeros which we call as the k-map by

6
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,059



7
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:15,690
using the mixed term now this is the

8
00:00:12,049 --> 00:00:15,690



9
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:20,789
next presentation in which we will solve

10
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:20,789



11
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:24,750
the example number two in which we are

12
00:00:20,779 --> 00:00:24,750



13
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:36,630
given a function f having the variables

14
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:36,630



15
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:45,660
a B C and D and the main terms are 1 3 4

16
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:45,660



17
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:48,899
5 9 11 14 15 so this is the quotient

18
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:48,899



19
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:50,850
given to you and in this quotient we

20
00:00:48,889 --> 00:00:50,850



21
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:53,969
will first try to find out the maximum

22
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,969



23
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:56,340
and then we will fill the k-map and try

24
00:00:53,959 --> 00:00:56,340



25
00:00:53,969 --> 00:01:01,820
to group the zeros and find the final

26
00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:01,820



27
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:07,890
answer so let's move to a solution

28
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:07,890



29
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:10,830
solution if you have studied from my

30
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,830



31
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:14,070
lectures the boolean algebra then most

32
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,070



33
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:16,680
probably you might remember that we use

34
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:16,680



35
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:19,140
this type of problem in which there was

36
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:19,140



37
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:22,380
the min term given to you and by using

38
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:22,380



39
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:25,380
this information we calculated or found

40
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:25,380



41
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:31,759
our max term so we will use the same

42
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:31,759



43
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:34,799
thing in which your F function is

44
00:01:31,749 --> 00:01:34,799



45
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:38,030
represented as the max demand for the

46
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:38,030



47
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:42,090
representation of the max term we use Pi

48
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:42,090



49
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:45,630
with capital M this summation with the

50
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,630



51
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:49,170
small M represents your min term min

52
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:49,170



53
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:54,240
term and this PI with capital M

54
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:54,240



55
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:56,040
represents your Max term okay and you

56
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:56,040



57
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,860
very well know that the mean terms are

58
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:58,860



59
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:01,290
obtained by the ones when the function

60
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:01,290



61
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:04,439
is 1 in your truth table and max term

62
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,439



63
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:07,229
are obtained when the function f is 0 in

64
00:02:04,429 --> 00:02:07,229



65
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:12,510
your tooth table so actually this values

66
00:02:07,219 --> 00:02:12,510



67
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:13,280
1 3 4 5 9 11 14 and 15 are representing

68
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,280



69
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:18,920
that the fun

70
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:18,920



71
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:22,459
option F is 1 for M 1 M 3 M 4 up to M 15

72
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:22,459



73
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:26,870
so you clearly know that for what we'll

74
00:02:22,449 --> 00:02:26,870



75
00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:30,860
use this function f is 0 it's actually 0

76
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:30,860



77
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:33,290
for the terms which are not involved in

78
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:33,290



79
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:40,569
this min term so we can see that 0 is

80
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:40,569



81
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:43,610
not involved so it is 0 for M 0 it is 0

82
00:02:40,559 --> 00:02:43,610



83
00:02:40,569 --> 00:02:48,200
for 2 because 2 is also involved in this

84
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:48,200



85
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:51,440
for 5 6 is not there 7 is not there

86
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:51,440



87
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:53,510
eight is not there 9 is there 10 is not

88
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:53,510



89
00:02:51,440 --> 00:03:01,840
there so 10 will be included in this max

90
00:02:53,500 --> 00:03:01,840



91
00:02:53,510 --> 00:03:03,980
term 11 12 13 12 13 14 15 okay fine so

92
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,980



93
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,440
this is something that we can obtain

94
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:06,440



95
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:09,769
from this information now we will make

96
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:09,769



97
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:11,959
the truth table and as you can see that

98
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:11,959



99
00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:15,260
there are four variables involved so 2

100
00:03:11,949 --> 00:03:15,260



101
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:17,000
to the power 4 is equal to 16 which

102
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,000



103
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:20,510
means that there are total 16

104
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:20,510



105
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,239
combinations possible and we require 16

106
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,239



107
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:26,420
cells in your key map to represent each

108
00:03:23,229 --> 00:03:26,420



109
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:29,680
of these combinations so for 4 variable

110
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:29,680



111
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:36,410
you very well know that we require a

112
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:36,410



113
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:38,840
16-7 16 cell k map so let's make it if

114
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,840



115
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:40,370
you want to try it by your own you can

116
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:40,370



117
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,650
pause the video and solve this problem

118
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,650



119
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:44,510
because you already know how to do it

120
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,510



121
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:48,049
with just data problem in the last

122
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:48,049



123
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:51,019
presentation so I hope you will do it

124
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:51,019



125
00:03:48,049 --> 00:03:55,489
without making any mistake till then I

126
00:03:51,009 --> 00:03:55,489



127
00:03:51,019 --> 00:03:57,530
will make my 16 cells K map ok so now

128
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:57,530



129
00:03:55,489 --> 00:04:09,820
it's completed let's write down the

130
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:09,820



131
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:16,130
variables a b c d 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0

132
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:16,130



133
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:20,989
1 1 1 1 0 fine now this is time to fill

134
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:20,989



135
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:23,090
up this cells okay so as the topic is

136
00:04:20,979 --> 00:04:23,090



137
00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:25,320
came up using the max term i am going to

138
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,320



139
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:29,130
fill this cell by zeros i am not going

140
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:29,130



141
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:35,370
the cell by using the ones so at zero

142
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:35,370



143
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:47,840
this your M 0 it is 0 self is 0 1 2 2 is

144
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:47,840



145
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:54,450
0 3 4 5 6 6 is 0 7 7 also 0 8 9 10 11 12

146
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:54,450



147
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:57,210
13 okay and 14 15 are 1 so it should be

148
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,210



149
00:04:54,450 --> 00:05:00,720
kept awakened so that the map should not

150
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,720



151
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:05,070
look messy so we have filled our zeros

152
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:05,070



153
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:08,850
it looks fine now this is time to group

154
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:08,850



155
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:15,090
this zeros and you know that we have to

156
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:15,090



157
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:18,570
make the groupings of zeros 2 4 4 8 16

158
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,570



159
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:19,020
and the priority is increasing in this

160
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,020



161
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:22,080
way

162
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:22,080



163
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:25,110
so we have to see for the 16 zeros which

164
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:25,110



165
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:27,420
is of course not in this game app we

166
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,420



167
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:30,390
have to look for 8 zeros that I cannot

168
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:30,390



169
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:32,490
find in this K map then we have to see

170
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,490



171
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:36,360
for 4 zeros and of course I can see

172
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:36,360



173
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:41,120
these 4 zeros and I can combine it in

174
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:41,120



175
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:43,320
this way ok and I will give it name one

176
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:43,320



177
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:47,120
let's change the color for the next

178
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:47,120



179
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:50,940
group after this I am not having any

180
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:50,940



181
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:55,110
combination of the four zeros anymore so

182
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:55,110



183
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:59,310
I look for the two zeros and you can see

184
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:59,310



185
00:05:55,110 --> 00:06:01,350
that this 0 this 0 and this 0 can easily

186
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,350



187
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:05,820
be combined in this way let's give it

188
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:05,820



189
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:08,310
name too and we'll change the color for

190
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:08,310



191
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:14,610
the next group and this is our next

192
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:14,610



193
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:17,970
group let's give it name 3 so all zeros

194
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,970



195
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:21,180
are now combined and this time to write

196
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,180



197
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:25,680
the function f and as you know that this

198
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:25,680



199
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:29,820
is this function is written here for

200
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:29,820



201
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:37,570
zeros so it should be F complement so

202
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:37,570



203
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:42,970
write F complement is equal to 1 or 2 or

204
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:42,970



205
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:46,440
three okay so the first one the first

206
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,440



207
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:50,920
group of zeros gives us let's see what

208
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:50,920



209
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:54,400
the a is changing from one to zero so

210
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:54,400



211
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:57,780
this should not be included B is zero

212
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:57,780



213
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:02,260
and it's not changing so we'll write B

214
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:02,260



215
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:06,730
complement let's see for C and D the C

216
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:06,730



217
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:13,170
is changing from 0 to 1 okay but these

218
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:13,170



219
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:15,850
not changing and s0 so right D

220
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,850



221
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:22,780
complement similarly for the second

222
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:22,780



223
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:27,040
group a complement B because a B is same

224
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:27,040



225
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:33,130
and you can see that D is changing from

226
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:33,130



227
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:35,860
1 to 0 and C is 1 so write C here

228
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,860



229
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:42,250
similarly for the third group we are

230
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:42,250



231
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:46,120
having a be C bar and this is for F

232
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,120



233
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:48,250
complement now we want F so we will use

234
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:48,250



235
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:51,010
the de Morgan's law we will complement

236
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,010



237
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:53,770
the both side and you are very good in

238
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,770



239
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:56,620
complementing the things so I am going

240
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,620



241
00:07:53,770 --> 00:08:03,550
to write this thing directly it is B or

242
00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:03,550



243
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:08,610
D and A or B complement or C complement

244
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:08,610



245
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:13,000
and a complement or B complement or C

246
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:13,000



247
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:15,820
okay so this is your answer now you

248
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:15,820



249
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,780
might be thinking that we have to do an

250
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:19,780



251
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:22,840
extra practice of the de Morgan's law to

252
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:22,840



253
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:24,940
get our answer but right now I am going

254
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,940



255
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,710
to tell you something that will keep you

256
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:26,710



257
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:29,490
away from this de Morgan's law

258
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,490



259
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:33,190
particularly in this problem that is

260
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:33,190



261
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:38,140
writing this answer directly so let's

262
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:38,140



263
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:42,930
see how we can do it we will just change

264
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:42,930



265
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:46,510
the values of the variables what it is

266
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:46,510



267
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:48,820
right now in the groups let's see how

268
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,820



269
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:50,520
for example I am taking this second

270
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:50,520



271
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:57,300
group this one

272
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:57,300



273
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:59,010
in this I found a as 0b as one and D was

274
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:59,010



275
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:01,740
changing from one to zero so it should

276
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,740



277
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:06,330
not be included but C is one so I was

278
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:06,330



279
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:08,640
having a compliment B see that I have

280
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,640



281
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:13,410
already written here but what we will do

282
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:13,410



283
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:17,279
now we will do two things we will write

284
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,279



285
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:22,339
any variable if it is zero we write it

286
00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:22,339



287
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:25,440
as a instead of writing as a compliment

288
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:25,440



289
00:09:22,339 --> 00:09:27,510
which means the low is considered to be

290
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:27,510



291
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,750
high and high is considered to be low

292
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,750



293
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:35,940
and also this and operation is

294
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:35,940



295
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:39,120
considered to be or okay so let's see

296
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:39,120



297
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:43,770
how we can do in the first group you can

298
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:43,770



299
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:46,320
see that a is changing from 1 to 0 so it

300
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,320



301
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:48,660
is not included but B is 0 so I am NOT

302
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:48,660



303
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,899
going to write B as B complement because

304
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:51,899



305
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:53,970
it is 0 but I will write it as B and I

306
00:09:51,889 --> 00:09:53,970



307
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:56,610
am NOT going to use this end operator

308
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,610



309
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:59,940
but I am going to use this or operator

310
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,940



311
00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:02,700
and in C and D you can easily see that C

312
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:02,700



313
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:05,160
is changing from 0 to 1 but D is not

314
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:05,160



315
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:07,260
changing and it is 0 but I am NOT going

316
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:07,260



317
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:11,790
to write D as d compliment but I will

318
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:11,790



319
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:15,570
write it as D because it is 0 so you can

320
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:15,570



321
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:19,230
see that we just found the first part of

322
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:19,230



323
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:21,360
our answer B or D similarly I will do

324
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,360



325
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:28,890
for the rest of the things and I will

326
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:28,890



327
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:31,649
find this easily we are not doing

328
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,649



329
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:34,290
anything extra we just using we are just

330
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:34,290



331
00:10:31,649 --> 00:10:36,630
using the de Morgan's law right here we

332
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,630



333
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:40,290
are just assuming 0 as 1 and 1 is 0 and

334
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:40,290



335
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:42,570
we are changing the end with on an orbit

336
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,570



337
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:45,360
and here there was all but we are using

338
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,360



339
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:48,380
end and here we are having end we are

340
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:48,380



341
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,490
using all so this is what we do in our

342
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:50,490



343
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:52,560
complement or you can say in our team

344
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,560



345
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:54,450
against law instead of doing an extra

346
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:54,450



347
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,920
step we are just writing it down because

348
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,920



349
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:59,940
we don't have that much of time in

350
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:59,940



351
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:02,250
examinations so I hope it was

352
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:02,250



353
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:04,410
interesting to you and you got how to

354
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,410



355
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:06,839
solve this K map

356
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,839



357
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:09,240
using the max term and also in the

358
00:11:06,829 --> 00:11:09,240



359
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:11,610
second last lecture we completed our kmm

360
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:11,610



361
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:14,190
by using the don't cares now the only

362
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,190



363
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:16,829
thing left in the k-map is the five

364
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,829



365
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:18,990
variable k-map that we'll see in the

366
00:11:16,819 --> 00:11:18,990



367
00:11:16,829 --> 00:11:21,300
next presentation and also the previous

368
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,300



369
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:23,970
year questions in the competitive exams

370
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:23,970



371
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:25,740
that we will also see in the coming time

372
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,740



373
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:27,980
so thanks for watching see in the next

374
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:27,980



375
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,980
presentation
